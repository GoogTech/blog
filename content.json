IntroI am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. This is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories. The first storyThe first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months. But then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out ? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, And she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him ?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, And all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting。 It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that make all the difference. The second storyMy second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was twenty. We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned thirty, and then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started ? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me. And for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at thirty I was out. and very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. Less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I retuned to Apple. And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don’t settle. The third storyMy third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today ?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now. This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die, even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you. But someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960’s, before personal computers and desktop publishing. So it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course. They put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, The kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin a new, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thanks you all, very much.","categories":[{"name":"Speech","slug":"Speech","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/categories/Speech/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Steve Jobs","slug":"Steve-Jobs","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Steve-Jobs/"},{"name":"Speech","slug":"Speech","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Speech/"}]},{"title":"Summary For August 2021","slug":"Summary-For-August-2021","date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.712Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/08/31/Summary-For-August-2021/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2021/08/31/Summary-For-August-2021/","excerpt":"","text":"✍ StudyThe Subject Of Data Structures And Algorithms( July, 7 ~ August, 8 )It’s costed thirty-one days to learn this subject firstly, and the learning content as shown below : finished a few multiple-choice questions but not all drew the knowledge mindmap realize the graph algorithm with code The Subject Of Operating System( Aug, 6 ~ 24 )It’s costed eighteen days to learn this subject firstly, and the learning content as shown below : finished the multiple-choice questions drew the knowledge mindmap The Subject Of Computer Network( Aug, 25 ~ 31 )It’s costed eight days to learn the chapter one and two of this subject, and the learning content as shown below : finished the multiple-choice questions drew the knowledge mindmap Two Thousand English Words( July, 18 ~ August, 20 )Oh, It makes me feel bad that this task doesn’t finish in a specified time, and the learning efficiency is terrible.So what’s the reason for it? procrastination less than thirty min every day not follow The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve 💪 Work outThe total time of working out is 15256 minutes and consumed 13425 calories, and the primary data of working out is as shown below : the sum of running distance is 122.24 kilometers there only had three days which the exercise time less than 30 min 😴 RestThe rest plan is to wake up at 5:30 am and go to sleep at 22:30 before in the nighttime, and this monthly data is as shown below : waking up at 5:30 with twenty-four days going to bed at 22:30 with twenty-four days 💲 ConsumptionThe excess consumption is 891.27￥ and other data is private so that no display there. 💬 Comment Make the best of the daytime and keep early hours Distribute the reasonable time to every task Not catch up but more effectiveness Get out of procrastination Not consume excessively","categories":[{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/categories/Summary/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Summary/"}]},{"title":"Your Love Is Gone","slug":"Your-Love-Is-Gone","date":"2021-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.732Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/08/29/Your-Love-Is-Gone/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2021/08/29/Your-Love-Is-Gone/","excerpt":"","text":"Wow, I💖this song so much so that I have still single loop all these days, and I think that its style like the &lt;Love Yourself&gt; of Justin Bieber, someday I will play it with the guitar and upload the video to my youtube channel, although on the current situation, that’s just a plan because I’m so busy for preparing the postgraduate examination recently.

I had arrived home on the 4th and started to review this subject after two days formally. Unfortunately, it’s regret that I didn’t have enough time to revise all the knowledge in the month-end, there has some reason as shown below for it : Realize some algorithms about the graph with code, such as BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra, Floyd, and TopologicalSorting Algorithm Realize some algorithms about the sort with code, such as StraightInsertionSort, BinaryInsertionSort, ShellSort, BubbleSort, QuickSort, SimpleSectionSort, HeapSort, MergeSort, and RadixSort Algorithm Realize some algorithms about the tree with code, such as PreorderTraversal, InorderTraversal, PostorderTraversal, and LevelOrderTraversal Algorithm Draw the knowledge mindmap But the final learn quality isn’t satisfactory to me because I wouldn’t like to finish the practice question after learning the new knowledge and blindly pursue the learning speed.

Yes, you guess right, that’s procrastination. 💪 Work outThe total time of working out is 603 minutes, consumed 4968 calories. The primary data of working out is as shown below : the sum of running distance is 19.41 kilometers there had twenty-five days which the exercise time was less than 30 min So terrible what I did this month, and this data is the lowest than the previous six months.

In this month, I often watch some short videos on my mobile phone all night so that the learning status is bad all daytime. That seems like a loop cycle and became a habit finally. That’s why the learning efficiency is so low in daily life. 💲 ConsumptionThe excess consumption is 219￥ and other data is private. 💬 Comment Not pursue the learning speed but more effectiveness Make the best of the daytime and keep early hours Get out procrastination 😔 By the way, there had a few days I feel anxious all day because my resume fell on deaf ears.","categories":[{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/categories/Summary/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Summary/"}]},{"title":"Shell极速入门教程","slug":"quick-start-tutorial-for-shell-language-beginner","date":"2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.788Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/06/26/quick-start-tutorial-for-shell-language-beginner/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2021/06/26/quick-start-tutorial-for-shell-language-beginner/","excerpt":"","text":"简介以下 Shell 程序均在 Windows 平台上编写😅, 开发工具为 VSCode, 开发环境为 GitBash.

[ $a -lt 20 -o $b -gt 100 ] 返回&nbsp;true. -a 与运算, 两个表达式都为 true 才返回 true. [ $a -lt 20 -a $b -gt 100 ] 返回&nbsp;false. 逻辑运算符假定变量 a 为 10, 变量 b 为 20. 运算符 说明 举例 &amp;&amp; 逻辑的 AND [[ $a -lt 100 &amp;&amp; $b -gt 100 ]] 返回 false || 逻辑的 OR [[ $a -lt 100 || $b -gt 100 ]] 返回 true 字符串运算符假定变量 a 为 “abc”, 变量 b 为 “efg”. 运算符 说明 举例 = 检测两个字符串是否相等, 相等返回 true [ $a = $b ] 返回 false != 检测两个字符串是否不相等, 不相等返回 true [ $a != $b ] 返回&nbsp;true -z 检测字符串长度是否为0, 为 0 返回 true [ -z $a ] 返回 false -n 检测字符串长度是否不为 0, 不为 0 返回 true [ -n \"$a\" ] 返回 true $ 检测字符串是否为空, 不为空返回 true [ $a ] 返回&nbsp;true 文件测试运算符 操作符 说明 举例 -b file 检测文件是否是块设备文件, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -b $file ] 返回 false -c file 检测文件是否是字符设备文件, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -c $file ] 返回&nbsp;false -d file 检测文件是否是目录, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -d $file ] 返回 false -f file 检测文件是否是普通文件(既不是目录, 也不是设备文件), 如果是, 则返回 true [ -f $file ] 返回&nbsp;true -g file 检测文件是否设置了 SGID 位, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -g $file ] 返回&nbsp;false -k file 检测文件是否设置了粘着位(Sticky Bit), 如果是, 则返回 true [ -k $file ] 返回&nbsp;false -p file 检测文件是否是有名管道, 如果是, 则返回 true. [ -p $file ] 返回&nbsp;false -u file 检测文件是否设置了 SUID 位, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -u $file ] 返回&nbsp;false -r file 检测文件是否可读, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -r $file ] 返回&nbsp;true -w file 检测文件是否可写, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -w $file ] 返回&nbsp;true -x file 检测文件是否可执行, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -x $file ] 返回&nbsp;true -s file 检测文件是否为空(文件大小是否大于0), 不为空返回 true [ -s $file ] 返回&nbsp;true -e file 检测文件(包括目录)是否存在, 如果是, 则返回 true [ -e $file ] 返回&nbsp;true printf 命令printf 由 POSIX 标准所定义, 因此使用 printf 的脚本比使用 echo 移植性好. 语法1printf format-string [arguments...] format-string : 为格式控制字符串 arguments : 为参数列表 123#!\\Git\\Git\\bin\\bashprintf &quot;Hello World \\n&quot;

p-&gt;next=s;B、 (*p).next=s; (*s).next=(*p).next;C、 s-&gt;next=p-&gt;next; p-&gt;next=s-&gt;next;D、 s-&gt;next=p-&gt;next; p-&gt;next=s; 答案 : D 解析 : s -&gt; next = p -&gt; next; : 将 s 节点的指针指向 p 节点的后一个节点 p -&gt; next = s; : 使 p 节点的指针指向 s 节点 14、在双向链表存储结构中, 删除 p 所指的结点时须修改指针( )。A、 p-&gt;next-&gt;prior=p-&gt;prior; p-&gt;prior-&gt;next=p-&gt;next;B、 p-&gt;next=p-&gt;next-&gt;next; p-&gt;next-&gt;prior=p;C、 p-&gt;prior-&gt;next=p; p-&gt;prior=p-&gt;prior-&gt;prior;D、 p-&gt;prior=p-&gt;next-&gt;next; p-&gt;next=p-&gt;prior-&gt;prior; 答案 : A 解析 : p -&gt; next -&gt; prior = p -&gt; prior; : 将 p 节点的后继节点的前驱指针, 指向 p 的前驱节点 p -&gt; prior -&gt; next = p -&gt; next; : 使 p 节点的前驱节点的后继指针, 指向 p 的后继节点 15、在双向循环链表中, 在 p 指针所指的结点后插入 q 所指向的新结点, 其修改指针的操作是( )。A、 p-&gt;next=q; q-&gt;prior=p; p-&gt;next-&gt;prior=q; q-&gt;next=q;B、 p-&gt;next=q; p-&gt;next-&gt;prior=q; q-&gt;prior=p; q-&gt;next=p-&gt;next;C、 q-&gt;prior=p; q-&gt;next=p-&gt;next; p-&gt;next-&gt;prior=q; p-&gt;next=q;D、 q-&gt;prior=p; q-&gt;next=p-&gt;next; p-&gt;next=q; p-&gt;next-&gt;prior=q; 答案 : C 解析 : q -&gt; prior = p; : 将 q 的前驱指针指向 p q -&gt; next = p -&gt; next; : 将 q 的后继指针指向 p 的后继节点 p -&gt; next -&gt; prior = q; : 将 p 的后继节点的前驱指针, 指向 q p -&gt; next = q : 将 p 的后继节点指向 q 16、串是一种特殊的线性表, 其特殊性体现在( )。A、 可以顺序存储B、 数据元素是一个字符C、 可以链式存储D、 数据元素可以是多个字符 答案 : B 解析 : 串是由零个或多个字符组成的有限序列. 18、在线性表的下列运算中, 不改变数据元素之间结构关系的运算是( )。A、 插入B、 删除C、 排序D、 查找 答案 : D 19、线性表采用链式存储时, 其地址( )。A、 必须是连续的B、 一定是不连续的C、 部分地址必须连续D、 连续与否均可以 答案 : D 20、线性表是( )。A、 一个有限序列,可以为空B、 一个有限序列,不可以为空C、 一个无限序列,可以为空D、 一个无限序列,不可以为空 答案 : A 解析 : 一个线性表是 n 个具有相同特性的数据元素的有限序列. 27、以下关于线性表的说法不正确的是______。A、 线性表中的数据元素可以是数字、字符、记录等不同类型。B、 线性表中包含的数据元素个数不是任意的。C、 线性表中的每个结点都有且只有一个直接前趋和直接后继。D、 存在这样的线性表:表中各结点都没有直接前趋和直接后继。 答案 : C 28、线性表的顺序存储结构是一种_______的存储结构。A、 随机存取B、 顺序存取C、 索引存取D、 散列存取 答案 : A 解析 : 顺序存储结构的地址在内存中是连续的, 所以可以通过计算地址实现随机存取. 而链式存储结构的存储地址不一定连续, 只能通过第个结点的指针顺序存取. 29、在顺序表中, 只要知道_______, 就可在相同时间内求出任一结点的存储地址。A、 基地址B、 结点大小C、 向量大小D、 基地址和结点大小 答案 : D 解析 : 顺序表是一组地址连续的存储单元, 依次存储表中的元素, 所以可以根据首元素的地址和节点所占空间大小, 直接访问顺序表中任一节点. 31、在______运算中, 使用顺序表比链表好。A、 插入B、 删除C、 根据序号查找D、 根据元素值查找 答案 : C 解析 : 可按元素序号随机访问是顺序表的特点之一. 58、将长度为 n 的单链表链接在长度为 m 的单链表后面, 其时间复杂度采用大 O 形式表示应该是（ ）。A、 O(1)B、 O(n)C、 O(m)D、 O(n+m ) 答案 : C 解析 : 需要先遍历长度为 m 的链表, 找到链表尾部, 这个时间复杂度为O(m), 然后再将链表尾部的 next 指针指向长度为 n 的链表的头结点即可. 59、与单链表相比，双链表的优点之一是（ ）A、 插入、删除操作更简单B、 可以随机访问C、 可省略表头指针或表尾指针D、 访问前后相邻结点更方便 答案 : D 解析 : 双链表比单链表多了prior指针, 所以访问前后相邻结点更方便了, 总的来说就是用空间换取时间. 60、设带带头结点的循环单链表L, 当L为空表时应满足（ ）A、 表头结点指针域next为空即L-&gt;next==NULLB、 L-的值为NULL即L==NULLC、 表头结点的指针域next与L的值相等即L-&gt;next==LD、 表头结点的指针域next与L的地址相等 答案 : C 解析 : L -&gt; next == L; : 即单链表 L 的指针指向自己. 61、在长度为n(n&gt;=1)的双链表中删除一个结点（非尾结点）要修改（）个指针。A、 1B、 2C、 3D、 4 答案 : B 62、与非循环单链表相比，循环单链表的主要优点是A、 不再需要头指针B、 已知某一结点的位置后，能够容易找到它的前驱结点C、 在进行插入、删除操作时，能更好地保持链表不断开D、 在表中任意结点出发都能扫描到整个链表 答案 : D 63、将两个分别含有m、n个结点的有序单链表归并成一个有序单链表, 对应算法的时间复杂度是（）。A、 O(n)B、 O(m)C、 O(n+m)D、 O(MIN(n+m)） 答案 : C 64、对于长度位n( n&gt;=1 )的双链表L, 在 p 所指结点之前插入一个新结点的算法时间复杂度为（ ）。A、 O(1)B、 O(n)C、 O(n^2)D、 O(nlog2n) 答案 : A 解析 : 因双链表较单链表有前驱指针, 所以在指定节点前进行的插入操作只需修改指针即可哈. 65、在长度为n（n&gt;=1）的循环双链表L中，删除尾结点的时间复杂度为（ ）。A、 O(1)B、 O(n)C、 O(n^2)D、 O(nlog2n) 答案 : A 解析 : 在非空的循环双向链表中, 头节点的前驱指针指向的节点即为尾结点. 66、将两个分别含有m、n个结点的有序单链表归并成一个有序单链表, 要求不破坏原有的单链表, 对应算法的时间复杂度是（ ）。A、 O(n)B、 O(n)C、 O(n+m)D、 O(MIN(m,n)) 答案 : C 67、在长度为n（n&gt;=1）的双链表 L 中, 删除 p 所指结点的时间复杂度为（ ）。A、 O(1)B、 O(n)C、 O(n^2)D、 O(nlog2n) 答案 : A 解析 : 先遍历O(n²)后删除O(1). 应选 C, 答案有误 ? 82、( 重复题目 ) 以下说法错误的是( )。A、 求表长、定位这两种运算在采用顺序存储结构时实现的效率不比采用链式存储结构时实现的效率低B、 顺序存储的线性表可以随机存取C、 由于顺序存储要求连续的存储区域,所以在存储管理上不够灵活D、 线性表的链式存储结构优于顺序存储结构 答案 : D 解析 : 链式存储结构和顺序存储结构各有优缺点, 有不同的适用场合. 栈86、若进栈序列为1,2,3,4,5,6, 且进栈和出栈可以穿插进行, 则可能出现的出栈序列为( )。A、 3,2,6,1,4,5B、 3,4,2,1,6,5C、 1,2,5,3,4,6D、 5,6,4,2,3,1 答案 : B 解析 : Stack 的特点为 First In Last Out / Last In First Out 哈.

左 -&gt; 右. 28．用一维数组存储二叉树时, 总是以前序遍历顺序存储结点。（ ） 答案 : 错 29．若已知一棵二叉树的前序遍历序列和后序遍历序列, 则可以恢复该二叉树。（ ） 答案 : 错 解析 : 恢复二叉树两种情况( 其中必须要有中序 ) 已知前序和中序 已知后序和中序 40．具有 n 个结点的二叉排序树有多种, 其中树高最小的二叉排序树是最佳的。（ ） 答案 : 对 42、栈和队列都是限制存取点的线性结构。（ ） 答案 : 对 解析 : 栈在栈顶对元素进行操作, 而队列在队头出队, 在队尾入队. 44、若一个栈的输入序列是1, 2, 3···n, 输出序列的第一个元素是i, 则第 i 个输出元素不确定。（ ） 答案 : 对 解析 : 栈的入栈与出栈的次序是不固定的哈. 46、链队列与循环队列相比, 前者不会发生溢出。（ ） 答案 : 对 48、( 重复题目 )数据元素是数据的最小单位。（ ） 答案 : 错 52.数据的逻辑结构与数据元素本身的内容和形式无关。（ ） 答案 : 对 53.一个数据结构是由一个逻辑结构和这个逻辑结构上的一个基本运算集构成的整体。（ ） 答案 : 对 55.数据的逻辑结构和数据的存储结构是相同的。（ ） 答案 : 错 解析 : 数据的逻辑结构用于描述数据之间的关系, 而数据的存储结构与相应数据在内存中的物理地址有关, 它是数据的逻辑结构在计算机上的具体语言实现. 57.从逻辑关系上讲, 数据结构主要分为线性结构和非线性结构。（ ） 答案 : 对 58.数据的存储结构是数据的逻辑结构的存储映像。（ ） 答案 : 错 解析 : 数据的逻辑结构可以独立于存储结构来考虑, 反之不可以. 59.数据的物理结构是指数据在计算机内实际的存储形式。（ ） 答案 : 对 数据的逻辑结构是依赖于计算机的。（ ） 答案 : 错 解析 : 数据的逻辑结构用于描述数据之间的关系, 而数据的存储结构与相应数据在内存中的物理地址有关, 它是数据的逻辑结构在计算机上的具体语言实现. 算法是对解题方法和的描述步骤。（ ） 答案 : 对 66．设一棵二叉树的先序序列和后序序列, 则能够唯一确定出该二叉树的形状。（ ） 答案 : 错 解析 : 恢复 / 确定二叉树两种情况( 其中必须要有中序 ) 已知前序和中序 已知后序和中序 69．线性表的顺序存储结构比链式存储结构更好。（ ） 答案 : 错 解析 : 各有所长哈, 例如顺序存储支持随机存取. 链式存储较线性存储, 其插入及删除的时间复杂度较低. 70．中序遍历二叉排序树可以得到一个有序的序列。（ ） 答案 : 对 解析 : 二叉排序树又称为二叉查找树, 它要么是一棵空树, 要么是具有下列性质的二叉树 : 若它的左子树不为空, 则左子树上所有结点的值均小于它的根结点的值 若它的右子树不为空, 则右子树上所有结点的值均大于它的根结点的值 它的左右子树也分别为二叉排序树 72.不论是入队列操作还是入栈操作, 在顺序存储结构上都需要考虑“ 溢出 ”情况。（ ） 答案 : 对 73．( ❗ )当向二叉排序树中插入一个结点，则该结点一定成为叶子结点。（ ） 答案 : 对 96．( 重复题目 )中序遍历一棵二叉排序树可以得到一个有序的序列。( ) 答案 : 对 97．入栈操作和入队列操作在链式存储结构上实现时不需要考虑栈溢出的情况。( ) 答案 : 对 解析 : 链式存储结构是动态分配空间的, 而在顺序存储则需要考虑栈溢出的情况哈. 应用题以下算法均使用 C++ 实现, 代码 注释详细、程序精简、而且每个程序都是单独 可运行 的哟 (●’◡’●)~ 不会 C++ 的童鞋可以看下我的这个笔记哈 : 两小时从 C 过渡到 C++ 单链表的插入123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165/** * @Author: GoogTech * @Email: googtech@qq.com * @Website: https://goog.tech/leetcode * @Date: 2021,6,21 * * 1.单链表的插入 * (1).从头节点进行插入 * (2).从尾节点进行插入 * (3).从指向节点前进行插入 * (4).从指定节点后进行插入 */#include &quot;iostream&quot;using namespace std;class List &#123;public: List() &#123;

SSH的安装 SSH分为客户端 openssh-client 和服务器 openssh-server，首先利用以下命令确认电脑上是否安装了客户端和服务器. 12345$ dpkg -l | grep ssh# 如果没有安装则可以通过以下命令进行安装$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server 检查 ssh-server 是否已经启动了. 1234567$ ps -e | grep ssh# 如果没有启动可以通过以下命令来启动$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start # 停止和重启ssh服务的命令如下所示 sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart SSH远程登录的两种方式方式一 : 口令登录命令格式为 : ssh 客户端用户名@服务器ip地址 1234567$ ssh &lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt;# 如果客户机的用户名和服务器的用户名相同,登录时可以省略用户名$ ssh &lt;remoteserver.ip&gt;# 如果需要调用图形界面程序可以使用 -X 选项$ ssh -X 123&lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt;# SSH服务的默认端口是22,我们可以使用 -p 选项来修改端口号$ ssh -p 123 &lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt; 方式二 : 公钥登录每次登录远程主机都需要输入密码是很不方便，如果想要省去这一步骤，可以利用密钥对进行连接，还可以提高安全性. 首先在本机生成密钥对1$ ssh-keygen -t rsa # -t表示类型选项,这里采用 rsa 加密算法 然后根据提示一步步的按enter键即可( 其中有一个提示是要求设置私钥口令passphrase，不设置则为空。这里看心情吧，如果不放心私钥的安全可以设置一下)，执行结束以后会在 /home/当前用户目录 下生成一个 .ssh 文件夹,其中包含 私钥文件 id_rsa 和 公钥文件 id_rsa.pub 将公钥复制到远程主机: 方法 A 将公钥复制到远程主机中( 但由于Windows上没有ssh-copy-id，我们可以使用方法 B ) 1$ ssh-copy-id &lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt; 使用 ssh-copy-id 命令将公钥复制到远程主机. ssh-copy-id会将公钥写到远程主机的 ~/.ssh/authorized_key 文件中. 经过以上两个步骤，以后再登录这个远程主机就不用再输入密码咯 ! 测试 12# 再次登录远程服务器时只需输入私钥密码即可.ssh &lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt; 将公钥复制到远程主机: 方法 B 首先将ssh key的公钥上传到远程主机 123$ scp &lt;windows上的公钥&gt; &lt;远程主机用户名&gt;@&lt;远程主机ip或者域名&gt;:~/.ssh/id_rsa.win.pub# 举例$ scp C:\\Users\\&lt;Windows_User&gt;\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub &lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt;:~/.ssh/id_rsa.win.pub 登录到远程主机，在远程主机上将windows的key添加到authorized_keys文件中. 12# &gt;&gt; : 将id_rsa.win.pub中的内容写入到authorized_keys文件中$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.win.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 测试 12# 再次登录远程服务器时只需输入私钥密码即可.ssh &lt;remote_username&gt;@&lt;remoteserver.ip&gt; 参考 SSH简介及两种远程登录的方法 如何在Widnows10上用ssh登录Ubuntu","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"SSH","slug":"SSH","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/SSH/"},{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"Ubuntu","slug":"Ubuntu","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Ubuntu/"}]},{"title":"Ubuntu18.04 安装Docker及基本使用","slug":"Ubuntu18-04-安装Docker及基本使用","date":"2020-06-22T13:08:18.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.724Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/06/22/Ubuntu18-04-安装Docker及基本使用/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2020/06/22/Ubuntu18-04-%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85Docker%E5%8F%8A%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8/","excerpt":"","text":"简介Docker 的架构图如下所示 Docker 是一个开源的应用容器引擎，基于 Go 语言并遵从 Apache2.0 协议开源。Docker 可以让开发者打包他们的应用以及依赖包到一个轻量级、可移植的容器中，然后发布到任何流行的 Linux 机器上，也可以实现虚拟化。容器是完全使用沙箱机制，相互之间不会有任何接口( 类似 iPhone 的 app ),更重要的是容器性能开销极低。Docker 从 17.03 版本之后分为 CE( Community Edition: 社区版 )和 EE( Enterprise Edition: 企业版 )，一般来说社区版就够我们使用的啦.

There’s a discussion of the reasons for that here. You’re attempting to bind to 86 and, therefore, it’s failing with “Permission denied”. The quickest and safest solution is to configure the port with a value that’s &gt; 1024. As you’re using Boot’s embedded Tomcat instance, the port’s configured in application.properties using the server.port property. 译文 : Linux不允许普通用户绑定 “&lt;= 1024” 的TCP端口。 这有一个关于原因的讨论这里。 所以这也就是为什么当你试图将端口绑定到80，它会抛出“权限不足”的错误信息的原因。最快和最安全的解决方案就是使用大于1024的值来配置端口。例如当你使用SpringBoot中的嵌入式Tomcat实例时，你可以通过配置application.properties中的server.port属性来指定端口号。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Exception","slug":"Exception","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Exception/"}]},{"title":"vsblog : 一个采用vue及springboot开发的超简洁的个人博客系统","slug":"vsblog-一个采用vue及springboot开发的超简洁的个人博客系统","date":"2020-06-21T12:23:26.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.788Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/06/21/vsblog-一个采用vue及springboot开发的超简洁的个人博客系统/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2020/06/21/vsblog-%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E9%87%87%E7%94%A8vue%E5%8F%8Aspringboot%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E7%9A%84%E8%B6%85%E7%AE%80%E6%B4%81%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","excerpt":"","text":"README.md最近在学习前后端分离开发模式，为了总结进而写了这个小项目 : http://49.233.79.152:8080 账号: admin，密码: iblog.run ( 拜托不要删除我的数据，请另行创建文章后测试 ) github repo : https://github.com/YUbuntu0109/vsblog 技术前端 : element-ui axios vue 后端 : hibernate validatior mybatis plus springboot mysql shiro redis jwt 截图 功能 登录验证 文章展示 文章添加 文章删除 文章修改 文章查找 文章归档 页面特效 点击特效 文章分类 友链 留言 部署 以下是我在 Ubuntu18.04 远程服务器上部署 vsblog 的流程. 安装 JDK 12345# install jdksudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless# checkjava -version 安装 MySQL8.0+ 123456789101112# the installation package as follows you need to download it# decompress the installation packagesudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.10-1_all.deb# update installation packagesudo apt update # install mysql serversudo apt install mysql-server # run mysqlmysql -u root -p 安装 Redis 12345678# install redis serversudo apt-get install redis-server# check redis server statusnetstat -nlt|grep 6379# testredis-cli 导入 vueblog.sql 数据库 12# mysql -u root -p &lt; vueblog.sqlmysql -u root -p &lt; &#x27;the specified path of database file&#x27; 运行项目 123456789# kill the specified server port:8080kill -9 $(netstat -nlp | grep :8080 | awk &#x27;&#123;print $7&#125;&#x27; | awk -F&quot;/&quot; &#x27;&#123; print $1 &#125;&#x27;)# run# nohup /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -jar /tmp/vueblog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &gt; vsblog.file 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;nuhup -jar vueblog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &gt; vsblog.file 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;# testhttp://ip:8080/ 绑定域名 忽略端口号，例如 : http://vue.iblog.run:8080 -&gt; http://vue.iblog.run 123456789101112131415161718192021222324# first you need install the nginxsudo apt install nginx# vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf# such as the example configuraion be added as followshttp&#123; server&#123; listen 80; server_name vue.iblog.run; location / &#123; proxy_pass http://ip:8080; &#125; &#125;&#125;. . .# then check the default configuration filenginx -t# reload the nginxnginx -s reload# testhttp://vue.iblog.run 注意事项若需本地运行该项目，请修改如下配置 : 前端 : axios.js 123// 自定义全局请求头(后台)// axios.defaults.baseURL = &quot;http://49.233.79.152:8080&quot;axios.defaults.baseURL = &quot;http://localhost:8080&quot; 后端 : application.yml 123redis-manager: // host: 49.233.79.152:6379 host: 127.0.0.1:6379 该项目使用的 MySQL 的版本号为 8.0.11 ,如果你的数据库版本低于它，请修改如下配置 : pom.xml : 修改 mysql-connector-java 的版本 application.yml : 将 driver-class-name 修改为 com.mysql.jdbc.Driver 详情请参考我的博文 : JDBC-常见错误分析 致谢 VBlog MarkerHub","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Vue","slug":"Vue","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Vue/"},{"name":"Spring Boot","slug":"Spring-Boot","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Spring-Boot/"}]},{"title":"image repo","slug":"image-repo","date":"2020-06-21T11:50:35.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.732Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/06/21/image-repo/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2020/06/21/image-repo/","excerpt":"","text":"blog logo 快速访问 : https://yubuntu0109.github.io/2020/06/21/image-repo/logo.png 本文章用于存储图片，解决后期链接图片在 README.md 等其它地方无法加载显示的问题.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"image","slug":"image","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/image/"}]},{"title":"用这些制作神器来美化你的截图吧 !","slug":"用这些制作神器来美化你的截图吧","date":"2020-06-21T10:09:41.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.948Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/06/21/用这些制作神器来美化你的截图吧/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2020/06/21/%E7%94%A8%E8%BF%99%E4%BA%9B%E5%88%B6%E4%BD%9C%E7%A5%9E%E5%99%A8%E6%9D%A5%E7%BE%8E%E5%8C%96%E4%BD%A0%E7%9A%84%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%E5%90%A7/","excerpt":"","text":"最近学习前后端分离开发模式，于是使用 vue 及 springboot 写了一个简洁的博客系统。为了在 README.md 中更好地展示该项目的截图，我在知乎上找到了两款比较好用的截图美化工具，美化后的效果如下 : https://github.com/YUbuntu0109/vsblog Screely : https://www.screely.com/ Screely是由荷兰UI/UX设计师、前端开发人员Jurn制作的一款在线网页展示效果生成工具，支持将你的屏幕截图和设计快速转变成精美的展示模型.Screely编辑展示效果支持添加或取消阴影效果、开启/关闭浏览器暗黑模式、不同浏览器窗口、不同窗口样式间进行选择，允许自定义背景颜色及透明背景效果，还可以调整图像周围的填充间距更改展示效果图的尺寸.

DevOps 迄今为止还没有得到广泛公认的定义以及确定的知识内容. 接下来就让我们通过 DevOps 的发展渊源来逐渐了解它吧~ DevOps 发展渊源DevOps是敏捷开发的延续，它将敏捷的精神延伸至运维( Operation )阶段. 敏捷开发的主要目的是响应变化，快速交付价值. 以 2001 年的 敏捷宣言 发布这个里程碑为起点，开始几年内企业主要在软件的开发阶段推行敏捷，并没有覆盖到软件的运维阶段. 随着互联网的不断发展，市场变化越来越快，2007年之后软件工程领域出现了新的变化，DevOps星星之火便开始出现~ 萌芽阶段( 2007~2008 年 )详情看书吧嘿嘿. . . . . . 社区确立阶段( 2009~2019 年 )详情看书吧嘿嘿. . . . . . 产业关注阶段( 2011~2012 年 )2019年 6 月，第二届 Velocity 大会在美国圣荷西召开，当时的 Flickr 技术运维资深副总裁 John Allspaw 和工程总监 Paul Hammond 一起在大会上做了一个题目为 “10 + Deploys per Day : Dav and Ops Cooperation at Flickr” 的演讲，演讲后来轰动了业界，也有力地证明了 Dev 和 Ops 可以有效工作在一起从而提高软件部署的可能性. Prtrick 在网上看到这个演讲后非常激动，受到大会的启发，他在比利时也发起了名为 DevOpsDays 的自己的会议，最后大会出奇地成功，以至于大家在 Twitter 上的讨论热情不减. 受限于 Twitter 上字符的长度，为了精简，大家就把 Twitter 上的话题 #DevOpsDays 简写成了 #DevOps 了，于是 DevOps 一词便在社区中慢慢确定了. 相关基础基础协同发展的阶段( 2013~ )详情看书吧嘿嘿. . . . . .

The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smallerincrements. This is where Travis CI comes in. As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your developmentprocess by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediatefeedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other partsof your development process by managing deployments and notifications. CI Builds and Automation: Building, Testing, DeployingWhen you run a build, Travis CI clones your GitHub repository into a brand-newvirtual environment, and carries out a series of tasks to build and test yourcode. If one or more of those tasks fail, the build is consideredbroken. If none of the tasks fail, the build isconsidered passed and Travis CI can deploy your codeto a web server or application host. CI builds can also automate other parts of your delivery workflow. This meansyou can have jobs depend on each other with Build Stages,set up notifications, preparedeployments after builds and many other tasks. Builds, Jobs, Stages and PhasesIn the Travis CI documentation, some common words have specific meanings: phase - the sequential stepsof a job. For example, the install phase, comes before the script phase,which comes before the optional deploy phase. job - an automated process that clones your repository into a virtualenvironment and then carries out a series of phases such as compiling yourcode, running tests, etc. A job fails, if the return code of the script phaseis non-zero. build - a group of jobs. For example, a build might have two jobs, eachof which tests a project with a different version of a programming language.A build finishes when all of its jobs are finished. stage - a group of jobs that run in parallel as part of a sequential buildprocess composed of multiple stages. Breaking the BuildThe build is considered broken, when one or more of its jobs complete with astate that is not passed: errored - a command in the before_install, install, or before_scriptphase returned a non-zero exit code. The job stops immediately. failed - a command in the script phase returned a non-zero exit code. Thejob continues to run until it completes. canceled - a user cancels the job before it completes. Our Common Builds Problems page is a good placeto start troubleshooting why your build is broken. Infrastructure and Environment NotesTravis CI offers a few different infrastructure environments, so you can selectthe setup that suits your project best: Ubuntu Linux - these Linux Ubuntu environments run inside full virtual machines, provide plenty of computational resources, and support the use of sudo, setuid, and setgid. Check out more information on the Ubuntu Linux Build Environment. macOS - uses one of several versions of the macOS operating system. This environment is useful for building projects that require the macOS software, such as projects written in Swift. It is not a requirement to use the macOS environment, if you develop on a macOS machine. Here you can find more details on the macOS Build Environment. Windows - currently Windows Server version 1803 is supported. If you want to know more about it, see the Windows Build Environment. More details on our build environments are available in our CI Environment documentation. 🚀 Now that you’ve read the basics, head over to our Tutorial for details on setting up your first build!

( Mediator Pattern : Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly,and it lets you vary their interaction independently. ) 中介者模式又称为调停者模式,它是一种对象行为模式. 在中介者设计模式中,通过引入中介者来简化对象之间的复杂交互,中介者模式是迪米特法则的一个典型应用 角色分析 Mediator( 抽象中介者 ) : 它定义一个接口,该接口用于与各同事对象之间进行通信. ConcreteMediator( 具体中介者 ) : 它是抽象中介者的子类,通过协调各个同事对象来实现协作行为,它维持了对各个同事对象的引用. Colleague( 抽象同事类 ) : 它定义各个同事类公有的方法,并声明了一些抽象方法供子类实现,同时它维持了一个对抽象中介者类的引用,其子类可以通过该引用与中介者通信. ConcreteColleague( 具体同时类 ) : 它是抽象同事类的子类,每一个同事对象在需要和其他同事对象通信时先与中介者通信,通过中介者间接完成与其他同事类的通信; 在具体同事类中实现了在抽象同事类中声明的抽象方法. 程序示例下面是一个使用中介者模式的简单示例程序 : 设计一个 CRM 桌面系统,其中包含一个客户信息管理模块,其界面组件之间存在复杂的交互关系,如果删除一个客户,则从客户列表中( List )中删掉对应的项,客户选择组合框( ComboBox )中的客户名称也将减少一个; 如果增加一个客户信息,则客户列表中将增加一个客户,并且组合框中也将增加一项. 为了更好地处理界面组件之间的交互,现使用中介者模式设计该系系统~ Mediator.java : 抽象中介者类 12345678910111213package pers.huangyuhui.mediator_pattern.mediator_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 抽象中介者类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 10/10/2019-12:49 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public abstract class Mediator &#123;

ConcreteObserver( 具体观察者 ) : 在具体观察者中维护了一个指向具体目标对象的引用,它存储具体观察者的有关状态,这些状态需要和目标的状态保持一致. 它实现了在抽象观察者 Observer 中定义的 update() 方法. 通常在实现时可以调用具体目标类的 attach() 方法将自己添加到目标类的集合中或通过 detach() 方法将自己从目标类的集合中删除. 示例程序下面是一个使用观察者设计模式的简单示例程序,模拟功能 : 在某多人联机对战游戏中,多个玩家可以加入同一战队组成联盟,当战队中的某一成员被敌人攻击时,其可以向其它队友发送求救通知,队友接收通知后作出相应的反应,既而来实现战队成员之间的联动~ AllyControllerCenter抽象类 : 指挥部(战队控制中心)类, 充当抽象目标类 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142package pers.huangyuhui.observer_pattern.observer_pattern_1;import java.util.ArrayList;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 指挥部(战队控制中心)类, 充当抽象目标类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/29/2019-12:02 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public abstract class AllyControllerCenter &#123; protected String allyName; //定义一个集合用于存储战队成员 protected ArrayList&lt;Observer&gt; players = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); public void setAllyName(String allyName) &#123; this.allyName = allyName; &#125; public String getAllyName(String allyName) &#123; return allyName; &#125; //注册方法 public void join(Observer observer) &#123; System.out.println(&quot;玩家: [ &quot; + observer.getName() + &quot; ]加入战队&quot;); players.add(observer); &#125; //注销方法 public void quit(Observer observer) &#123; System.out.println(&quot;玩家: [ &quot; + observer.getName() + &quot; ]退出战队&quot;); players.remove(observer); &#125; //声明抽象通知方法 public abstract void noifyObserver(String name);&#125; ConcreteAllyControlCenter类 : 具体指挥部类, 充当具体目标类 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829package pers.huangyuhui.observer_pattern.observer_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 具体指挥部类, 充当具体目标类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/29/2019-12:16 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class ConcreteAllyControlCenter extends AllyControllerCenter &#123; public ConcreteAllyControlCenter(String allyName) &#123; this.allyName = allyName; System.out.println(&quot;------ 战队: [ &quot; + allyName + &quot; ]组建成功 ------&quot;); &#125; //实现通知方法 @Override public void noifyObserver(String name) &#123; System.out.println(&quot;战队: [ &quot; + this.allyName + &quot; ]指挥部发送的紧急通知 : 队友[ &quot; + name + &quot; ]正在遭受敌人攻击&quot;); //遍历观察者集合,调用每一个队友(除自己)的支援方法 for (Observer player : players) &#123; if (!(player.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name))) &#123; player.help(); &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125; Observer接口 : 抽象观察者类 1234567891011121314151617181920package pers.huangyuhui.observer_pattern.observer_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 抽象观察者类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/29/2019-12:05 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public interface Observer &#123; String getName(); void setName(String name); void help(); //声明支援盟友的方法 void beAttacked(AllyControllerCenter allyControllerCenter); //声明遭受攻击的方法&#125; Player类 : 战队成员类, 充当具体观察者类 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142package pers.huangyuhui.observer_pattern.observer_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 战队成员类, 充当具体观察者类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/29/2019-12:21 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class Player implements Observer &#123; private String name; public Player(String name) &#123; this.name = name; &#125; @Override public String getName() &#123; return name; &#125; @Override public void setName(String name) &#123; this.name = name; &#125; //支援盟友方法的实现 @Override public void help() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;坚持住!

Receiver( 接收者 ) : 接收者执行与请求相关的操作,具体实现对请求业务的处理. 示例程序-1下面是一个使用命令设计模式的简单程序案例,案例说明 : 某系统提供了一系列功能键,用户可以自定义功能键( FunctionButton )的功能,例如登录键( LoginInCommand )用于登录系统,退出键( LoginOutCommand )用于注销系统 · · · FunctionButton类 : 功能键类, 充当请求调用者(请求发送者) 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 功能键类, 充当请求调用者(请求发送者) * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-8:59 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class FunctionButton &#123; private Command command; //为功能键注入命令 public void setCommand(Command command) &#123; this.command = command; &#125; //发送请求的方法 public void click() &#123; command.execute(); &#125;&#125; Command抽象类 : 抽象命令类 12345678910111213package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 抽象命令类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-9:01 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public abstract class Command &#123; public abstract void execute();&#125; LoginInCommand类 : 登录命令类, 充当具体命令类 123456789101112131415161718192021222324package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 登录命令类, 充当具体命令类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-9:07 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class LoginInCommand extends Command &#123; private LoginInSystem enterSystem; public LoginInCommand() &#123; this.enterSystem = new LoginInSystem(); &#125; //命令执行方法,将调用请求接收者的业务方法 @Override public void execute() &#123; enterSystem.login(); &#125;&#125; LoginOutCommand类 : 退出命令类, 充当具体命令类 123456789101112131415161718192021222324package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 退出命令类, 充当具体命令类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-9:05 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class LoginOutCommand extends Command &#123; private LoginOutSystem exitSystem; public LoginOutCommand() &#123; this.exitSystem = new LoginOutSystem(); &#125; //命令执行方法,将调用请求接受者的业务方法 @Override public void execute() &#123; exitSystem.exit(); &#125;&#125; LoginInSystem类 : 登录系统的模拟实现类, 充当请求接收者 12345678910111213141516package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 登录系统的模拟实现类, 充当请求接收者 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-9:10 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class LoginInSystem &#123; public void login() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;login in&quot;); &#125;&#125; LoginOutSystem类 : 退出系统的模拟实现类, 充当请求接收者 12345678910111213141516package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 退出系统的模拟实现类, 充当请求接收者 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-9:08 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class LoginOutSystem &#123; public void exit() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;login out&quot;); &#125;&#125; Client类 : 客户端测试类 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425package pers.huangyuhui.command_pattern.command_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 客户端测试类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/20/2019-9:11 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class Client &#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; FunctionButton functionButton = new FunctionButton(); Command login_key = new LoginInCommand(); functionButton.setCommand(login_key); functionButton.click(); System.out.println(&quot;--------------------&quot;); Command exit_key = new LoginOutCommand(); functionButton.setCommand(exit_key); functionButton.click(); &#125;&#125; 示例程序运行的结果如下所示 : 123login in--------------------login out 示例程序的类图 示例程序-2下面是一个使用命令设计模式的简单程序案例,案例说明 : 设计一个画图软件,既用户可以通过拖动鼠标在画板上画画,点击 clear 按钮时会擦除画板上的痕迹.

Builder 即可是抽象类,也可以是接口. ConcreteBuilder( 具体建造者 ) : 它实现了 Builder 接口,实现了各个部件的具体构造和装配方法,定义并明确所创建的复杂对象,还可以提供一个用于返回创建好的复杂产品的方法( 该方法可以由抽象构建者实现 ). Product( 产品 ) : 它是被创建的复杂对象,包含多个组成部件,具体建造者创建该产品的内部表示并定义它的装配过程. Director( 指挥者 ) : 指挥者又称为导演类,它负责安排复杂对象的建造次序,指挥者与抽象构建者之间存在关联关系,可以在其 construct() 建造方法中调用建造者对象的部件构造与装配方法,完成复杂对象的建造. 示例程序下面是一个使用了建造者设计模式的简单示例程序,其概述为 : 无论是何种游戏角色,都需要逐步创建其组成部分,再将各组成部分配装成一个完整的游戏角色.

( Facade Pattern : Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a highter-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. ) 扩 : 外观模式又称门面模式,它是一种对象结构型模式. 外观模式是迪米特法则的一种具体实现,通过引入一个新的外观角色来降低原有系统的复杂度,同时降低客户类与子系统的耦合度. 外观设计模式中使用的角色 Facade( 外观角色 ) : 在客户端可以调用它的方法,在外观角色中知道相关的( 一个或多个 )子系统的功能和责任. 在正常情况下,它将所有从客户端发来的请求委派到相应的子系统,传递给相应的子系统对象处理. SubSystem( 子系统角色 ) : 在软件系统中有一个或者多个子系统角色,每一个子系统可以不是一个单独的类,而是一个类的集合,它实现了子系统的功能. 每一个子系统都可以被客户端直接调用,或者被外观角色调用,它处理由外观类传递过来的请求. 子系统并不知道外观类的存在,对于子系统而言,外观角色仅仅是另外一个客户端而已. 扩 : 外观模式中所指的子系统是一个广义的概念,它可以是一个类,一个功能模块,系统的一个组成部分或者一个完整的系统. 通常所指一些业务类,实现了一些具体的,独立的业务功能. 示例程序下面是一个使用外观设计模式的简单示例程序 : 写一个用于文件加密的模块,该模块的功能为对指定文件中的数据进行加密并将加密之后的数据保存到新的文件中. 具体流程包括三个部分 : 读取源文件中的数据, 数据加密, 将加密后的数据写入到新文件 FileReader类 : 文件读取类, 充当子系统类 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728package pers.huangyuhui.facade_pattern.facade_pattern_1;import java.io.FileInputStream;import java.io.IOException;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 文件读取类, 充当子系统类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/12/2019-9:36 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class FileReader &#123; public String read(String path) &#123; var stringBuffer = new StringBuilder(); try (var fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(path)) &#123; var data = 0; while ((data = fileInputStream.read()) != -1) &#123; stringBuffer.append((char) data); //char &#125; &#125; catch (IOException e) &#123; e.printStackTrace(); &#125; return stringBuffer.toString(); &#125;&#125; CipherMachine类 : 数据加密类(求模运算), 充当子系统类 123456789101112131415161718192021package pers.huangyuhui.facade_pattern.facade_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 数据加密类(求模运算), 充当子系统类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/12/2019-9:42 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class CipherMachine &#123; public String encrypt(String text) &#123; var result = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; text.length(); i++) &#123; var s = String.valueOf(text.charAt(i) % 7); result.append(s); &#125; return result.toString(); &#125;&#125; FileWriter类 : 文件保存类, 充当子类系统类 1234567891011121314151617181920212223package pers.huangyuhui.facade_pattern.facade_pattern_1;import java.io.FileOutputStream;import java.io.IOException;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 文件保存类, 充当子类系统类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/12/2019-9:56 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class FileWriter &#123; public void write(String encryptStr, String path) &#123; try (var fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(path)) &#123; fileOutputStream.write(encryptStr.getBytes()); &#125; catch (IOException e) &#123; e.printStackTrace(); &#125; &#125;&#125; EncryptFacade类 : 加密外观类, 充当外观类 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132package pers.huangyuhui.facade_pattern.facade_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 加密外观类, 充当外观类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/12/2019-9:59 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class EncryptFacade &#123; //维持对子系统对象的引用 private FileReader fileReader; private CipherMachine cipherMachine; private FileWriter fileWriter; public EncryptFacade() &#123; fileReader = new FileReader(); cipherMachine = new CipherMachine(); fileWriter = new FileWriter(); &#125; //调用子系统对象的业务方法 public void fileEncrypt(String fromPath, String toPath) &#123; var text = fileReader.read(fromPath); System.out.println(&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; : 读取文件[ &quot; + fromPath + &quot; ]中的明文数据 : &quot; + text); var encryptStr = cipherMachine.encrypt(text); System.out.println(&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; : 明文数据加密后的结果 : &quot; + encryptStr); fileWriter.write(encryptStr, toPath); &#125;&#125; Client类 : 客户端测试类 1234567891011121314151617181920package pers.huangyuhui.facade_pattern.facade_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 客户端测试类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/14/2019-6:05 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class Client &#123; private static final String FROM_PATH = &quot;src\\\\main\\\\java\\\\pers\\\\huangyuhui\\\\facade_pattern\\\\facade_pattern_1\\\\from.txt&quot;; private static final String TO_PATH = &quot;src\\\\main\\\\java\\\\pers\\\\huangyuhui\\\\facade_pattern\\\\facade_pattern_1\\\\to.txt&quot;; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; EncryptFacade encryptFacade = new EncryptFacade(); encryptFacade.fileEncrypt(FROM_PATH, TO_PATH); &#125;&#125; from.txt : 源文件,用于存储待加密的数据 1YUbuntu0109 程序运行结果如下所示 : 12&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; : 读取文件[ src\\main\\java\\pers\\huangyuhui\\facade_pattern\\facade_pattern_1\\from.txt ]中的明文数据 : YUbuntu0109&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; : 明文数据加密后的结果 : 51055456061 to.txt : 目标文件,用于存储加密后的数据( 程序运行后的该文件中的内容如下所示 ) 151055456061 示例程序的类图 示例程序-抽象外观类在标准的外观模式结构中,如果需要增加,删除或更换与外观类交互的子类,必须修改外观类或客户端的代码,这将违背开闭原则,因此可以通过引入抽象外观类对系统进行改进,即客户端针对抽象外观类进行编程,在运行时再确定具体的外观类.

(Composite Pattern : Compose objects into tree structures to pepresent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uninformly.) 扩 : 组合模式又称部分-整体( Part-Whole )模式,属于对象结构型模式,它将对象组织到树形结构中,可以用来描述整体与部分的关系 组合模式中的角色 Component( 抽象构件 ) : 它可以是接口或抽象类,为叶子构件和容器构件对象声明接口,在该角色中可以包含所有子类共有行为的声明和实现. 在抽象构件中定义了访问及管理它的子构件的方法,如增加,删除,获取子构件等. Leaf( 叶子构件 ) : 它在组合结构中表示叶子结点对象,叶子节点没有子结点,它实现了在抽象构件中定义的行为. 对于那些访问及管理子构件的方法,可以通过抛出异常,提示错误等方式进行处理. Composite( 容器构件 ) : 它在组合结构中表示容器节点对象,容器结点包含子结点,其子结点可以是叶子结点,也可以是容器结点,它提供了一个集合用于存储子结点,实现了在抽象构件中定义的行为,包括哪些访问及管理子构件的方法,在其业务方法中可以递归调用其自子结点的业务方法. 扩 : 组合模式的关键在于定义了一个抽象构件类,它既可以代表叶子,又可以代表容器,客户端针对该抽象构件类进行编程,无须知道它到底表示的叶子还是容器,可以对其进行统一处理. 同时容器对象与抽象构件类之间还建立一个聚合关联关系,在容器对象中既可以包含叶子,又可以包含容器,以此实现递归组合,形成一个树形结构. 适用环境Java SE中的 AWT 和 Swing 包的设计就基于组合模式,在这些界面包中为用户提供了大量的容器构件,如 Container( 容器构件 ) 和成员构件,如 Checkbox, Button, TextComponent( 一些叶子构件 )等,其都继承自 Componet 抽象类( 抽象构件 ) 示例程序1下面是一个使用组合设计模式的简单示例程序,这段示例程序的功能为列出文件夹及其中文件的名称及大小~ Entry抽象类 : 表示目录条目的抽象类, 充当Component角色 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930package pers.huangyuhui.composite_pattern.composite_pattern_1;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 表示目录条目的抽象类, 充当Component角色 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/11/2019-12:16 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public abstract class Entry &#123;

( Decorator Pattern : Attach additonal responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality ) 装饰设计模式中的角色 Component ( 抽象构件 ) : 它是具体构件和抽象装饰类的共同父类,声明了在具体构件中实现的业务方法,它的引入可以使客户端以一致的方式处理未被装饰的对象及装饰之后的对象,实现客户端的透明操作. ConcreteComponent ( 具体构件 ) : 它是抽象构件类的子类,用于定义具体的构件对象,实现了在抽象构件中声明的方法,装饰类可以给它增加额外的职责( 方法 ) Decorator ( 抽象装饰类 ) : 它也是抽象构件类的子类,用于给具体构件增加职责,但是具体职责在其子类中实现. 它维护一个指向抽象构件的引用,通过该引用可以调用装饰之前构件对象的方法,并通过子类扩展该方法,继而达到装饰的目的. ConcreteDecorator ( 具体装饰类 ) : 它是抽象装饰类的子类,负责向构件添加新的职责. 每一个具体装饰类都定义了一些新的行为,它可以调用在抽象装饰类中定义的方法,并可以增加新的方法用于扩展对象的行为. 示例程序-透明装饰模式下面是一个使用了装饰设计模式的简单示例程序,其示例说明为 : 使用面向对象技术开发了一套图形界面构件库,该构件库提供了大量的基本结构,如窗体,文本框,列表框等,由于在使用时用户经常要求定制一些特殊的显示效果,如带滚动条的窗体,或带黑色边框的文本框等. 因此经常需要对该构件库进行扩展以增强其功能,既而可以使用装饰设计模式来设计该界面构件库哟~ Component接口 : 抽象界面构件类, 充当抽象构件类 1234567891011121314package pers.huangyuhui.decorator_pattern;/** * @project: design-patterns * @description: 抽象界面构件类, 充当抽象构件类 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 9/9/2019-2:47 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public abstract class Component &#123;

JDK10 中一共定义了109个新特性,其中包含12个 JEP,还有一些新 API 和 JVM 规范以及 Java 语言规范上的改动,JDK10 的12个 JEP( JDK Enhancement Proposal 特性加强提议 )如下所示,更多信息请参阅官方文档 : http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/ Local-Variable Type Inference (主要重点:局部变量类型推断) Consolidate the JDK Forest into a Single Repository (JDK库的合并) Garbage-Collector Interface (统一的垃圾回收接口) Parallel Full GC for G1 (为G1提供并行的Full GC) Application Class-Data Sharing (应用程序类数据( AppCDS )共享) Thread-Local Handshakes (threadLocal握手交互) Remove the Native-Header Generation Tool (javah) (移除JDK中附带的javah工具) Additional Unicode Language-Tag Extensions (使用附加的Unicode语言标记扩展) Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices (在可选内存设备上进行堆分配) Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler (使用基于Java的JIT编译器) Root Certificates (根证书) Time-Based Release Versioning (基于时间的发布版本) 局部变量类型推断前言很多人抱怨 Java 是一种强类型,需要引入大量的样板代码. 甚至在这些情况下,给定好变量名,通常很清楚发生了什么,明显类型声明往往被认为是不必要的. 许多流行的编程语言都已经支持某种形式的局部变量类型推断 : 如C++ (auto), C# (var), Scala (var/val), Go (declaration with :=)等 简介Java 局部变量类型推断( LVTI ),JDK10 中可以使用 var 作为局部变量类型推断标识符,此符号仅适用于局部变量,增强for循环的索引,以及传统for循环的本地变量. 它不能使用于方法形式参数,构造函数形式参数,方法返回类型,字段,catch块形式参数或任何其他类型的变量声明. 标识符 var 不是关键字,相反,它是一个保留的类型名称. 这意味着 var 用作变量,方法名或则包名称的代码不会受到影响. 但 var 不能作为类或则接口的名字( 但这样命名是比较罕见的,因为他违反了通常的命名约定,类和接口首字母应该大写 ). 其工作原理为 : 在处理 var 时,编译器先是查看表达式右边部分,并根据右边变量值的类型进行推断,作为左边变量的类型,然后将该类型写入字符码当中 示例类型推断代码示例 : 123456var str = &quot;ABC&quot;; //根据推断为字符串类型var l = 10L; //根据10L推断为long类型var flag = true; //根据true推断为boolean类型var flag1 = 1; //这里会推断boolean类型,0表示false非0表示truevar list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); //推断为ArrayList&lt;String&gt;var stream = list.stream(); //推断为Stream&lt;String&gt; 上述示例代码的反编译class文件 : 123456String str = &quot;ABC&quot;;long l = 10L;boolean flag = true;int flag1 = true;ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList();Stream&lt;String&gt; stream = list.stream(); 遍历代码中使用类型推断 : 12345//集合遍历var list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();for (var s : list) &#123; &#125;//普通遍历for (var i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) &#123; &#125; var 类型可以被final修饰符修饰 1final int limit = 10; 注意在局部变量使用中,这些情况不适用类型推断哟 : 没有初始化的局部变量声明, 方法的返回类型, 方法的参数类型, 构造器的参数类型, 属性, catch块. 部分示例如下所示 初始值不能为null,既如果局部变量不赋值,则无法实现类型推断 123//errorvar string1;var string2 = null; 为数组静态初始化中,语法格式需要注意 123int[] array = &#123;1, 2, 3, 4, 5&#125;; //正确写法var array2 = new int[]&#123;1, 2, 3, 4, 5&#125;; //正确写法var array3 = &#123;1, 2, 3, 4, 5&#125;; //错误写法 Lambda表达式及方法引用中,左边的函数式接口不能声明为 var 123456789//正确写法Comparator&lt;Integer&gt;

ClassLoader classLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader(); InputStream is = classLoader.getResourceAsStream(&quot;from.txt&quot;); OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(&quot;to.txt&quot;); try (is; os) &#123; assert is != null; is.transferTo(os); &#125; catch (IOException e) &#123; e.printStackTrace(); &#125;&#125; 增强的 Stream APIJava 的 Stream API 是 Java 标准款最好的改进之一,让开发者能够快速运算,从而能够有效的利用数据并行计算. Java 8 提供的Stream能够利用多核架构实现声明式的数据处理. 而在 Java 9 中,Stream API 变得更好,Stream 接口中添加了4个新方法 ( takeWhile, dropWhile, ofNullable, iterate的重载方法 ), 及为你提供一个 Predicate( 判断条件 )来指定什么时候结束迭代. 除了对 Stream 本身的扩展, Optional 和 Stream 之间的结合也得到了改进,现在可以通过 Optional 的新对象 stream() 来将一个 Optional 对象转换为一个可能为空的 Stream 对象. 程序示例如下所示 : 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940public void testStream() &#123; //takeWhile: 可以用于从Stream中获取一部分数据,接受一个Predicate来进行选择,在有序的Stream中,takeWhile返回从头开始的尽可能多的元素 List&lt;Integer&gt; list = Arrays.asList(45, 43, 76, 87, 42, 77, 90, 73, 67, 88); list.stream().takeWhile((x) -&gt; x &lt; 80).forEach(System.out::println); //运行结果 : 45 43 76 //从返回结果可以看出:takeWhile将会按照list集合有序的从45开始到第一个不符合条件为止的所有结果 //dropWhile: dropWhile方法刚好与takeWhile想法,返回剩余的元素 List&lt;Integer&gt; list2 = Arrays.asList(45, 43, 76, 87, 42, 77, 90, 73, 67, 88); list2.stream().dropWhile((x) -&gt; x &lt; 80).forEach(System.out::println); //运行结果 :87 42 77 90 73 67 88 //从返回结果可以看出:dropWhile方法刚好和takeWhile方法形成互补,按照list集合有序的返回从第一个不满足条件元素开始到最后为止的所有结果 //ofNullable: 在JDK8中Stream不能完全为null,否则会报空指针异常. 而在JDK9中ofNullable方法允许创建一个为空的Stream //Stream&lt;Object&gt; stream1 = Stream.of(null); //System.out.println(stream1.count());//NullPointerException //不报异常,允许这样写 Stream&lt;String&gt; stringStream = Stream.of(&quot;AA&quot;, &quot;BB&quot;, null); System.out.println(stringStream.count()); //程序运行结果:3 //不报异常,允许这样写 List&lt;String&gt; list3 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); list3.add(&quot;A&quot;); list3.add(null); System.out.println(list3.stream().count()); //程序运行结果:2 //ofNullable():允许值为 null Stream&lt;Object&gt; stream = Stream.ofNullable(null); System.out.println(stream.count()); //程序运行结果:0 Stream&lt;String&gt; stream2 = Stream.ofNullable(&quot;Hello World&quot;); System.out.println(stream2.count()); //程序运行结果:1 //iterate()的重载方法 //JDK8 使用iterate方法,需配合limit截止 Stream.iterate(1, (x) -&gt; x + 1).limit(10).forEach(System.out::print); //JDK9 使用iterate的重载方法可以直接使用Predicate来截止 Stream.iterate(1, (x) -&gt; x &lt;= 10, (x) -&gt; x + 1).forEach(System.out::print); //程序运行结果:12345678910&#125; 改进的 Optional 类Optional 类是在JDK8中新增的类,主要是为了解决空指针异常. 在JDK9中对这个类进行了改进,主要是新增了三个方法 : stream, ifPresentOrElse 和 or stream : 将 Optional转为一个 Stream,如果 Optional 没有值就返回一个 Stream.empty ifPresentOrElse : 如果 Optional 包含值,则对其包含的值调用函数 action,即 action.accept(value),这与 ifPresent 一致.与 ifPresent 方法的区别在于 ifPresentOrElse 还有第二个参数 emptyAction. 如果 Optional 不包含值,那么 ifPresentOrElse 便会调用 emptyAction,即 emptyAction.run() or : 如果 Optional 有值,返回 Optional 指定的值,否则返回一个预设的值 全新的 HTTP 客服端 APIJDK9 中有新的方式来处理 HTTP 调用. 它提供了一个新的HTTP客户端(HttpClient),它将替代仅适用于 blocking 模式的HttpURLConnection( HttpURLConnection是在HTTP 1.0的时代创建的,并使用了协议无关的方法 ),并提供对 WebSocket 和 HTTP/2 的支持. 此外,HTTP 客户端还提供 API 来处理 HTTP/2 的特性,比如流和服务器推送等功能. 全新的 HTTP 客户端 API 可以从 jdk.incubator.httpclient 模块中获取. 因为在默认情况下,这个模块是不能根据 classpath 获取的,需要使用add modules命令选项配置这个模块,将这个模块添加到 classpath中 javadoc 的 HTML5 支持JDK8 生成的 java 帮助文档是在 HTML4 中,而HTML4 已经是很久的标准了.

JDK 9将 JDK 分成一组模块,可以在编译时,运行时或构建时进行组合. 模块化可以减少内存开销,只需必要的模块,并非全部模块,既而可以简化各种类库和大型应用的开发和维护 实例 模块目录结构如下所示( 有两个名称分别为modela, modelb的模块 ) : modela模块中的module-info.java : 123module modela &#123; exports com.cnblogs.bean;&#125;

default void print()&#123; System.out.println(&quot;this is a car&quot;); &#125;&#125; 多个默认方法一个接口有默认方法,考虑这样的情况,一个类实现了多个接口,且这些接口有相同的默认方法,以下实例说明了这种情况的解决方法 : 1234567891011public interface Vehicle &#123;

&#125;&#125; 第一个解决方案是创建自己的默认方法,来覆盖重写接口的默认方法 : 12345public class Car implements Vehicle, FourWheeler &#123; default void print()&#123; System.out.println(&quot;this is a motorcycle&quot;); &#125;&#125; 第二种解决方案可以使用 super 来调用指定接口的默认方法 : 12345public class Car implements Vehicle, FourWheeler &#123; public void print()&#123; Vehicle.super.print(); &#125;&#125; 静态默认方法Java 8 的另一个特性是接口可以声明( 并且可以提供实现 )静态方法,例如 : 123456789public interface Vehicle &#123;

Stream 使用一种类似用 SQL 语句从数据库查询数据的直观方式来提供一种对 Java 集合运算和表达的高阶抽象. 其 API 可以极大提高Java程序员的生产力,让程序员写出高效率、干净、简洁的代码. 其把将要处理的元素集合看作一种流, 流在管道中传输, 并且可以在管道的节点上进行处理, 比如筛选,排序,聚合等, 元素流在管道中经过中间操作 (intermediate operation) 的处理,最后由最终操作 (terminal operation) 得到前面处理的结果 123+--------------------+ +------+ +------+ +---+ +-------+| stream of elements +-----&gt; |filter+-&gt; |sorted+-&gt; |map+-&gt; |collect|+--------------------+ +------+ +------+ +---+ +-------+ 以上的流程可以转换Java代码 : 123456List&lt;Integer&gt; transactionsIds = widgets.stream() .filter(b -&gt; b.getColor() == RED) .sorted((x,y) -&gt; x.getWeight() - y.getWeight()) .mapToInt(Widget::getWeight) .sum(); 特征Stream (流) 是一个来自数据源的元素队列并支持聚合操作 : 元素是特定类型的对象,形成一个队列. Java中的Stream并不会存储元素,而是按需计算 数据源,流的来源可以是集合,数组,I/O channel,产生器generator等 聚合操作,类似SQL语句一样的操作,比如filter, map, reduce, find, match, sorted等 和以前的Collection操作不同， Stream操作还有如下两个基础的特征 : Pipelining : 中间操作都会返回流对象本身, 这样多个操作可以串联成一个管道,如同流式风格(fluent style), 这样做可以对操作进行优化,比如延迟执行(laziness)和短路(short-circuiting) 内部迭代 : 以前对集合遍历都是通过Iterator或者For-Each的方式, 显式的在集合外部进行迭代,这叫做外部迭代. Stream则提供了内部迭代的方式,通过访问者模式(Visitor)实现 当使用一个流的时候,通常包括三个基本步骤 : 获取一个数据源(source) -&gt; 数据转换 -&gt; 执行操作获取想要的结果,每次转换原有 Stream 对象不改变,返回一个新的 Stream 对象(可以有多次转换),这就允许对其操作可以像链条一样排列,变成一个管道. 注 : Steam流属于管道流,既只能被消费/使用一次哟 获取Stream流的方式java.util.stream.Stream&lt;T&gt;是Java8新加入的最常用的流接口 (注 : 这并不是一个函数式接口哟),获取一个流非常简单,有以下几种常用的方式 : 所有的Collection集合都可以通过stream默认方法获取流 通过Stream接口的静态方法of可以获取数组对应的流 Stream流的常用方法Stream流模型的操作很丰富,其方法可以划分为两类 : 延迟方法 : 返回值类型仍然是Stream接口自身类型的方法,因此支持链式调用( 除了终结方法外,其余方法均为延迟方法 ) 终结方法 : 返回值类型不再是Stream接口自身类型的方法,因此不再支持类似StringBuilder那样的链式调用,终结方法例如count和forEach 程序示例(对比)话不多说,来对比一下传统遍历并过滤集合与使用Stream流遍历并过滤集合的代码,感受下Stream流的美~ 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465package pers.huangyuhui.Stream;import org.junit.Test;import java.util.ArrayList;import java.util.List;/** * @project: jdk-learnig * @description: 使用Stream流遍历并过滤集合 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 8/18/2019-9:10 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class StreamTest &#123;

POJO有一些Private的参数作为对象的属性. 然后针对每个参数定义了get和set方法作为访问的接口,POJO对象有时也被称为Data对象，大量应用于表现现实中的对象. 一个POJO持久化以后就是PO. 直接用它传递、传递过程中就是DTO. 直接用来对应表示层就是VO DAO(Data Access Object数据访问对象)这个大家最熟悉,和上面几个O区别最大,基本没有互相转化的可能性和必要. 主要用来封装对数据库的访问,通过它可以把POJO持久化为PO,用PO组装出来VO、DTO Controller(控制层)控制层主要由Action / Servlet等构成( 目前Spring MVC则是通过@Controller标签使用 ),此层业务层与视图层打交道的中间层,负责传输VO对象和调用BO层的业务方法,负责视图层请求的数据处理后响应给视图层 View(视图层)主要是指由JSP、HTML等文件形成的显示层,总结一下要用具体的X0需要看具体环境及项目架构,在不同的层、不同的应用场合,对象的身份也不一样,而且对象身份的转化也是很自然的. 就像你对老婆来说就是老公,对父母来说就是子女. 设计这些概念的初衷不是为了唬人而是为了更好的理解和处理各种逻辑,让大家能更好的去用面向对象的方式处理问题 上述名词在实际项目的应用举例控制层( controller-action ),业务层/服务层( bo-manager ),实体层( po-entity ),数据访问( dao ),视图对象( Vo-本项目省略 ),视图层( view-jsp/html ) 在平时开发项目中大家记得要精细设计各层,既而避免后续项目开发中产生不必要的大量重复工作. 如果不是大型系统可简化一些层,毕竟技术是为应用服务哒~ 🙏摘自(获益匪浅,非常感谢) : https://www.cnblogs.com/EasonJim/p/7967949.html","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"SpringBoot整合FreeMarker","slug":"SpringBoot整合FreeMarker","date":"2019-08-14T09:43:05.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.708Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/08/14/SpringBoot整合FreeMarker/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/08/14/SpringBoot%E6%95%B4%E5%90%88FreeMarker/","excerpt":"","text":"学习笔记 : Spring Boot整合FreeMarkerFreeMarker官方简介Apache FreeMarker™ is a template engine: a Java library to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.) based on templates and changing data. Templates are written in the FreeMarker Template Language (FTL), which is a simple, specialized language (not a full-blown programming language like PHP). Usually, a general-purpose programming language (like Java) is used to prepare the data (issue database queries, do business calculations). Then, Apache FreeMarker displays that prepared data using templates. In the template you are focusing on how to present the data, and outside the template you are focusing on what data to present. This approach is often referred to as the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern, and is particularly popular for dynamic web pages. It helps in separating web page designers (HTML authors) from developers (Java programmers usually).

For more information, please refer to : http://shiro.apache.org/web.html#Web-taglibrary Tag Library ConfigurationThe Tag Library Descriptor (TLD) file is bundled in shiro-web.jar in the META-INF/shiro.tld file. To use any of the tags, add the following line to the top of your JSP page (or wherever you define page directives) : 1&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;shiro&quot; uri=&quot;http://shiro.apache.org/tags&quot;

如果第一个放的是username或者是一个值,那么就可以直接用 12&lt;!--取到username--&gt;&lt;shiro: principal/&gt; 如果第一个参数放的是对象,比如放User对象. 那么如果要取其中某一个值,可以通过property属性来指定 12&lt;!--需要指定property--&gt;&lt;shiro:principal property=&quot;username&quot;/&gt;

消息只占用一行,任何行都不能超过 100 个字符 允许使用 GitHub 以及各种 Git 工具阅读消息 提交消息由页眉、正文和页脚组成,由空行分隔 HeaderHeader部分只有一行,包括三个字段 : type(必需)、scope(可选)、和subject(必需) type代表某次提交的类型,比如是修复一个 bug 或是增加一个 feature,类型如下 : 类型 说明 feat 新增feature fix 修复bug docs 仅仅修改了文档,比如README , CHANGELOG , CONTRIBUTE等等 style 修改了空格,格式缩进,逗号等,不改变代码逻辑 refactor 代码重构,没有添加新功能或修复Bug perf 优化相关,比如提升性能,体验 test 测试用例,包括单元测试,集成测试等 chore 改变构建流程,或者增加依赖库,工具等 revert 回滚到上一个版本 scope用于说明 commit 影响的范围,可以是指定提交更改位置的任何内容,如 : 对 package.json 文件新增依赖库，chore(package.json): 新增依赖库 或对代码进行重构，refacto(weChat.vue): 重构微信进件 subject是 commit 目的的简短描述,不超过50个字符. 如果没有更合适的范围,可以直接写提交内容,格式要求如下 : 以动词开头,使用第一人称现在时,比如change,而不是changed或changes 第一个字母小写 结尾不加句号( . ) BodyBody 部分是对本次 commit 的详细描述,可以分成多行. 下面是一个范例 : 1234567More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or so. Further paragraphs come after blank lines.- Bullet points are okay, too- Use a hanging indent 有两个注意点 : 使用第一人称现在时,比如使用change而不是changed或changes 应该说明代码变动的动机,以及与以前行为的对比 FooterFooter 部分只用于两种情况 : 不兼容变动 : 如果当前代码与上一个版本不兼容,则 Footer 部分以BREAKING CHANGE开头,后面是对变动的描述、以及变动理由和迁移方法,示例如下 : 1234567891011121314151617BREAKING CHANGE: isolate scope bindings definition has changed. To migrate the code follow the example below: Before: scope: &#123; myAttr: &#x27;attribute&#x27;, &#125; After: scope: &#123; myAttr: &#x27;@&#x27;, &#125; The removed `inject` wasn&#x27;t generaly useful for directives so there should be no code using it. 关闭 Issue : 如果当前 commit 针对某个issue,那么可以在 Footer 部分关闭这个 issue : 1Closes #234 也可以一次关闭多个 issue : 1Closes #123, #245, #992 Revert还有一种特殊情况,如果当前 commit 用于撤销以前的 commit,则必须以revert:开头，后面跟着被撤销 Commit 的 Header,示例如下 : 123revert: feat(pencil): add &#x27;graphiteWidth&#x27; optionThis reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02. Body部分的格式是固定的，必须写成This reverts commit &amp;lt;hash&gt;,其中的hash是被撤销 commit 的SHA标识符。 ✨规范参考链接 : https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commits/dev https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/master 🙏文章参考链接(获益匪浅,非常感谢) : https://www.cnblogs.com/wubaiqing/p/10307605.html http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2016/01/commit_message_change_log.html","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"github_","slug":"github","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/github/"}]},{"title":"为GitHub量身定制的浏览器插件","slug":"为GitHub量身定制的浏览器插件","date":"2019-08-08T08:29:09.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.796Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/08/08/为GitHub量身定制的浏览器插件/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/08/08/%E4%B8%BAGitHub%E9%87%8F%E8%BA%AB%E5%AE%9A%E5%88%B6%E7%9A%84%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6/","excerpt":"","text":"力推几款为GitHub量身定制的浏览器插件OctotreeGitHub现有的目录层级形式,在查看来自不同层级文件夹的文件的时候显得似乎不是很方便,体验相当糟糕,只能重复地点进一个文件夹,再进入其中一个文件夹,如此循环. 尤其是在文件繁多的项目之中,文件夹嵌套堪称噩梦,一个个点击太费时间和精力. 而octotree这款插件则可以解决这个痛点,他能够像 IDE 一样提供项目目录,快捷导航,方便浏览 ! https://github.com/ovity/octotree Awesome Autocomplete for GitHub Awesome Autocomplete for GitHub是一款GitHub智能搜索插件 : 有点类似自动补全功能,实时监听输入的搜索关键字,自动列出相关内容. 正如官方介绍 : 致力于打造 GitHub 上最好的搜索引擎,助你在搜索仓库和用户方面,比以往更快人一步 ! https://github.com/algolia/github-awesome-autocomplete Isometric ContributionsIsometric Contributions是一款可以将冷冰冰的数据转化为生动图形的扩展程序 : 它可以将你每天的contributions数目转化为颜色不一的立体柱状图,并给出自己的统计数据.

/** * The CacheManager to use to perform caching operations to enhance performance. Can be null. */ private CacheManager cacheManager; /** * The EventBus to use to use to publish and receive events of interest during Shiro&#x27;s lifecycle. * @since 1.3 */ private EventBus eventBus; /** * Default no-arg constructor that will automatically attempt to initialize a default cacheManager */ public CachingSecurityManager() &#123; //use a default event bus: setEventBus(new DefaultEventBus()); &#125; // ······&#125; 另外,接口org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm定义了权限数据的存储方式,其类图如下所示 : 显然,org.apache.shiro.realm.CachingRealm是Shiro中Realm接口的基础实现类,我们同样来看一下其源码结构(如下所示),发现同样在CachingRealm也存在一个CacheManager类型的成员变量 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930public abstract class CachingRealm implements Realm, Nameable, CacheManagerAware, LogoutAware &#123; private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CachingRealm.class); //TODO - complete JavaDoc private static final AtomicInteger INSTANCE_COUNT = new AtomicInteger(); /*-------------------------------------------- | I N S T A N C E V A R I A B L E S | ============================================*/ private String name; private boolean cachingEnabled; private CacheManager cacheManager; /** * Default no-argument constructor that defaults * &#123;@link #isCachingEnabled() cachingEnabled&#125; (for general caching) to &#123;@code true&#125; and sets a * default &#123;@link #getName() name&#125; based on the class name. * &lt;p/&gt; * Note that while in general, caching may be enabled by default, subclasses have control over * if specific caching is enabled. */ public CachingRealm() &#123; this.cachingEnabled = true; this.name = getClass().getName() + &quot;_&quot; + INSTANCE_COUNT.getAndIncrement(); &#125; // ······&#125; 总结从以上分析我们知道Shiro支持在2个地方定义缓存管理器,既可以在SecurityManager中定义,也可以在Realm中定义,任选其一即可. 通常我们都会自定义Realm实现,例如将权限数据存放在数据库中,那么在Realm实现中定义缓存管理器再合适不过了 那么我们不禁要问了 : 第一 : 为什么Shiro要设计成既可以在Realm,也可以在SecurityManager中设置缓存管理器呢 ? 第二 : 分别在Realm和SecurityManager定义的缓存管理器,他们有什么区别或联系吗 ? 怀着种种疑问让我们追踪一下org.apache.shiro.mgt.RealmSecurityManae的源码实现,如下所示 : 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728public abstract class RealmSecurityManager extends CachingSecurityManager &#123; /** * Sets the internal &#123;@link #getCacheManager CacheManager&#125; on any internal configured * &#123;@link #getRealms Realms&#125; that implement the &#123;@link org.apache.shiro.cache.CacheManagerAware CacheManagerAware&#125; interface. * &lt;p/&gt; * This method is called after setting a cacheManager on this securityManager via the * &#123;@link #setCacheManager(org.apache.shiro.cache.CacheManager) setCacheManager&#125; method to allow it to be propagated * down to all the internal Realms that would need to use it. * &lt;p/&gt; * It is also called after setting one or more realms via the &#123;@link #setRealm setRealm&#125; or * &#123;@link #setRealms setRealms&#125; methods to allow these newly available realms to be given the cache manager * already in use. */ protected void applyCacheManagerToRealms() &#123; CacheManager cacheManager = getCacheManager(); Collection&lt;Realm&gt; realms = getRealms(); if (cacheManager != null &amp;&amp; realms != null &amp;&amp; !realms.isEmpty()) &#123; for (Realm realm : realms) &#123; if (realm instanceof CacheManagerAware) &#123; ((CacheManagerAware) realm).setCacheManager(cacheManager); &#125; &#125; &#125; &#125; // ······&#125; 这下恍然大悟了吧 ! 从源码可以分析出其实在SecurityManager中设置的CacheManager都会给Realm使用,即真正使用CacheManager的组件是Realm 🙏摘自(获益匪浅,非常感谢) : https://www.cnblogs.com/nuccch/p/8044226.html","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Shiro","slug":"Shiro","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Shiro/"}]},{"title":"SpringBoot中Shiro集成EhCache","slug":"SpringBoot中Shiro集成EhCache","date":"2019-08-07T12:10:32.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.708Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/08/07/SpringBoot中Shiro集成EhCache/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/08/07/SpringBoot%E4%B8%ADShiro%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90EhCache/","excerpt":"","text":"学习笔记 : SpringBoot项目中Shiro集成EhCache示例程序摘自 : 一个简单的SpringBoot整合Shiro的权限管理案例 添加依赖Shiro-learning/spring boot project with shiro/springboot-shiro/pom.xml 1234567891011121314&lt;dependencies&gt; &lt;!-- Shiro --&gt; &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.shiro&lt;/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;shiro-spring&lt;/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;1.4.1&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt; &lt;!-- Ehcache --&gt; &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.shiro&lt;/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;shiro-ehcache&lt;/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;1.4.1&lt;/version&gt; &lt;/dependency&gt;&lt;/dependencies&gt; 创建EhCache缓存配置文件Shiro-learning/spring boot project with shiro/springboot-shiro/src/main/resources/ehcache-shiro.xml 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374757677787980&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;ehcache xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=&quot;http://ehcache.org/ehcache.xsd&quot; updateCheck=&quot;false&quot; name=&quot;myEhcache&quot;&gt; &lt;diskStore path=&quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 授权信息缓存 --&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;authorizationCache&quot; maxEntriesLocalHeap=&quot;2000&quot; timeToIdleSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; timeToLiveSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; overflowToDisk=&quot;false&quot; statistics=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/cache&gt; &lt;!-- 身份信息缓存 --&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;authenticationCache&quot; maxEntriesLocalHeap=&quot;2000&quot; timeToIdleSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; timeToLiveSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; overflowToDisk=&quot;false&quot; statistics=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/cache&gt; &lt;!-- Session缓存 --&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;activeSessionCache&quot; maxEntriesLocalHeap=&quot;2000&quot; timeToIdleSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; timeToLiveSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; overflowToDisk=&quot;false&quot; statistics=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/cache&gt; &lt;!-- 缓存半小时 --&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;halfHour&quot; maxElementsInMemory=&quot;10000&quot; maxElementsOnDisk=&quot;100000&quot; timeToIdleSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; timeToLiveSeconds=&quot;1800&quot; overflowToDisk=&quot;false&quot; diskPersistent=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 缓存一小时 --&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;hour&quot; maxElementsInMemory=&quot;10000&quot; maxElementsOnDisk=&quot;100000&quot; timeToIdleSeconds=&quot;3600&quot; timeToLiveSeconds=&quot;3600&quot; overflowToDisk=&quot;false&quot; diskPersistent=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 缓存一天 --&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;oneDay&quot; maxElementsInMemory=&quot;10000&quot; maxElementsOnDisk=&quot;100000&quot; timeToIdleSeconds=&quot;86400&quot; timeToLiveSeconds=&quot;86400&quot; overflowToDisk=&quot;false&quot; diskPersistent=&quot;false&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- name: 缓存名称。 maxElementsInMemory: 缓存最大个数 eternal: 对象是否永久有效,一但设置了,timeout将不起作用 timeToIdleSeconds: 设置对象在失效前的允许闲置时间(单位：秒). 仅当eternal=false对象不是永久有效时使用,可选属性,默认值是0,也就是可闲置时间无穷大 timeToLiveSeconds: 设置对象在失效前允许存活时间(单位：秒). 最大时间介于创建时间和失效时间之间. 仅当eternal=false对象不是永久有效时使用,默认是0,也就是对象存活时间无穷大 overflowToDisk: 当内存中对象数量达到maxElementsInMemory时,Ehcache将会对象写到磁盘中 diskSpoolBufferSizeMB: 这个参数设置DiskStore(磁盘缓存)的缓存区大小,默认是30MB. 每个Cache都应该有自己的一个缓冲区 maxElementsOnDisk: 硬盘最大缓存个数 diskPersistent: 是否缓存虚拟机重启期数据 Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.

//有权限&#125; else &#123; //无权限&#125; 注解式 : 通过在执行的Java方法上放置相应的注解完成 1234@RequiresRoles(&quot;admin&quot;)public void hello() &#123; //有权限&#125; JSP/GSP 标签 : 在JSP/GSP页面通过相应的标签完成 123&lt;shiro:hasRole name=&quot;admin&quot;&gt;&lt;!— 有权限 —&gt;&lt;/shiro:hasRole&gt; 授权流程 首先调用Subject.isPermitted*/hasRole*接口,其会委托给SecurityManager,而SecurityManager接着会委托给Authorizer Authorizer是真正的授权者,如果我们调用如isPermitted(“user:create”),其首先会通过PermissionResolver把字符串转换成相应的Permission实例 在进行授权之前,其会调用相应的Realm获取Subject相应的角色/权限用于匹配传入的角色/权限 Authorizer会判断Realm的角色/权限是否和传入的匹配,如果有多个Realm,则会委托给ModularRealmAuthorizer进行循环判断,如果匹配如isPermitted*/hasRole*会返回true,否则返回false以表示授权失败 ini方式检查用户拥有的角色通过加载ini配置文件的方式,来实现一个用于检查用户是否拥有指定角色的程序~ pom.xml : Maven依赖 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&lt;dependencies&gt;

Shiro可以帮助我们完成 : 认证、授权、加密、会话管理、与Web集成、缓存等. 其基本功能点及其解析如下所示 : Authentication : 身份认证 / 登录,验证用户是不是拥有相应的身份 Authorization : 授权,即权限验证,验证某个已认证的用户是否拥有某个权限. 即判断用户是否能做事情,常见的如 : 验证某个用户是否拥有某个角色,或者细粒度的验证某个用户对某个资源是否具有某个权限 Session Manager : 会话管理,即用户登录后就是一次会话,在没有退出之前,它的所有信息都在会话中. 会话可以是普通JavaSE环境的,也可以是如Web环境的 Cryptography : 加密,保护数据的安全性,如密码加密存储到数据库,而不是明文存储 Web Support : Web支持,可以非常容易的集成到Web环境中 Caching : 缓存,比如用户登录后,其用户信息、拥有的角色 / 权限不必每次去查,这样可以提高效率 Concurrency : shiro支持多线程应用的并发验证,即如在一个线程中开启另一个线程,能把权限自动传播过去 Testing : 提供测试支持 Run As : 允许一个用户假装为另一个用户(在他们允许的情况下)的身份进行访问 Remember Me : 记住我,这个是非常常见的功能,即一次登录后,下次不用重复登录了 外部结构外部架构图,即从应用程序角度的来观察如何使用Shiro完成工作 : 可以看到,应用代码直接交互的对象是Subject,也就是说Shiro的对外API核心就是Subject. 其每个API的含义如下所示 : Subject : 主体,代表了当前”用户”,这个用户不一定是一个具体的人,与当前应用交互的任何东西都是Subject,如网络爬虫,机器人等,即为一个抽象概念. 所有Subject都绑定到SecurityManager,与Subject的所有交互都会委托给SecurityManager. 可以把Subject认为是一个门面,SecurityManager才是实际的执行者 SecurityManager : 安全管理器,即所有与安全有关的操作都会与SecurityManager交互,且它管理着所有Subject. 可以看出它是Shiro的核心,它负责与后边介绍的其他组件进行交互,如果学习过SpringMVC,你可以把它看成DispatcherServlet前端控制器 Realm : 域,Shiro从Realm获取安全数据(如用户、角色、权限),就是说SecurityManager要验证用户身份,那么它需要从Realm获取相应的用户进行比较以确定用户身份是否合法,也需要从Realm得到用户相应的角色 / 权限进行验证用户是否能进行操作. 可以把Realm看成 DataSource,即安全数据源 也就是说,最简单的一个Shiro应用可以基本分为以下两个步骤 : 应用代码通过Subject来进行认证和授权,而Subject又将所有的互交都委托给了SecurityManager 我们需要给Shiro的SecurityManager注入Realm,从而让SecurityManager能得到合法的用户及其权限进行判断 从以上也可以看出,Shiro不提供维护用户 / 权限,而是通过Realm让开发人员自己注入 内部结构接下来我们来从Shiro内部来看下Shiro的架构,如下图所示 : Subject : 主体,可以看到主体可以是任何可以与应用交互的”用户” SecurityManager : 相当于SpringMVC中的DispatcherServlet或Struts2中的FilterDispatcher; 是Shiro的心脏. 所有具体的交互都通过SecurityManager进行控制,它管理着所有Subject、且负责进行认证和授权、及会话、缓存的管理 Authenticator : 认证器,负责主体认证的,这是一个扩展点,如果用户觉得Shiro默认的不好,可以自定义实现. 其需要认证策略(Authentication Strategy),即什么情况下算用户认证通过了 Authrizer : 授权器,或者访问控制器,用来决定主体是否有权限进行相应的操作,即控制着用户能访问应用中的哪些功能 Realm : 可以有1个或多个Realm,可以认为是安全实体数据源,即用于获取安全实体. 可以是JDBC实现,也可以是LDAP实现,或者内存实现等,由用户提供. 注意 : Shiro不知道你的用户 / 权限存储在哪及以何种格式存储,所以我们一般在应用中都需要实现自己的Realm SessionManager : 如果写过Servlet就应该知道Session的概念,Session需要有人去管理它的生命周期,这个组件就是SessionManager,而Shiro并不仅仅可以用在Web环境,也可以用在如普通的JavaSE环境、EJB等环境. 所以Shiro就抽象了一个自己的Session来管理主体与应用之间交互的数据. 这样的话,比如我们在Web环境用,刚开始是一台Web服务器,接着又上了台EJB服务器,这时想把两台服务器的会话数据放到一个地方,这个时候就可以实现自己的分布式会话(如把数据放到Memcached服务器) SessionDAO : DAO大家都用过,数据访问对象,用于会话的CRUD,比如我们想把Session保存到数据库,那么可以实现自己的 SessionDAO,通过如JDBC写到数据库. 比如想把Session放到Memcached中,可以实现自己的Memcached SessionDAO. 另外SessionDAO中可以使用Cache进行缓存,以提高性能 CacheManager : 缓存控制器,来管理如用户、角色、权限等的缓存的. 因为这些数据基本上很少去改变,放到缓存中后可以提高访问的性能 Cryptography : 密码模块,Shiro提高了一些常见的加密组件用于如密码加密 / 解密 案例第一个Shiro程序接下来通过一个简单的用户身份验证程序,来感受一下Shiro的魅力吧 ! pom.xml : Maven依赖 1234567891011121314151617181920&lt;dependencies&gt;

var vm = new Vue(&#123; el: &#x27;#app&#x27;, data: &#123; list: [1, 2, 3] &#125; &#125;);&lt;/script&gt; 使用v-for遍历对象 : 1234567891011121314151617&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt; &lt;p v-for=&quot;(val,key,i) in user&quot;&gt;INDEX:&#123;&#123;i&#125;&#125;---&gt;&#123;&#123;key&#125;&#125;---&gt;&#123;&#123;val&#125;&#125;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt;

&#125; ] &#125; &#125;);&lt;/script&gt; 列表渲染中的key在使用v-for时,最好为每个迭代元素提供一个不重复的key. 因为当列表渲染被重新执行(数组内容发生变化)时,若不适用key,Vue会为数组成员就近复用已存在的DOM节点,如下图所示 : 当使用key时,Vue会根据key的变化重新排列节点顺序,并移除key不存在的节点 ! 其实质是 : key的存在是为DOM节点标注了一个身份信息,继而让Vue有迹可循地追踪到数据对应的节点 ! 示例程序如下 : 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;

&lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;resources/vue.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;title&gt;first program for Vue&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&#123;&#123; message &#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; var app = new Vue(&#123; el: &#x27;#app&#x27;, data: &#123; message: &#x27;Hello Vue!&#x27; &#125; &#125;); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; View 层 1&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&#123;&#123; message &#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt; ViewModel 层 12345678&lt;script&gt;var app = new Vue(&#123; el: &#x27;#app&#x27;, data: &#123; message: &#x27;Hello Vue!&#x27; &#125;&#125;);&lt;/script&gt; Model 层 12345&lt;script&gt;data: &#123; message: &#x27;Hello Vue!&#x27;&#125;&lt;/script&gt; 第一个Vue实例在这个实例中,初始化了带有’message’数据的’vm’对象,并将其绑定到’id’为’app’的DOM节点上. 初始化时,在实例上绑定的常规数据对象会被Vue转换为被观察的拥有可响应行为的对象,简单点说,就是当数据发生改变时,会同步更新其数据链和作用域中所有的相关状态,例如当实例数据发生改变时,视图也随之变化. 下面就义这个简单的Vue实例为例,简单地解析一下其语法 : 12345678910111213141516171819&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;resources/vue.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;title&gt;first program for Vue&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&#123;&#123; message &#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; var app = new Vue(&#123; el: &#x27;#app&#x27;, data: &#123; message: &#x27;Hello Vue!&#x27; &#125; &#125;); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; vm : 通过构造函数Vue就可以创建一个Vue的根实例,并启动Vue应用,变量vm就代表这个Vue实例. 例如 : 12345&lt;script&gt;var vm = new Vue(&#123; &#125;);&lt;/script&gt; el : 实际上,所有代码都是一个对象写入Vue实例(vm)内的. 首先,必不可少的一个选项就是el,其用于指定一个页面中已存在的DOM元素来挂载Vue实例,它可以是HTMLElement,也可以是CSS选择器,挂载成功后继而可以通过vm.$el来访问该元素,例如 : 1234567&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt;var vm = new Vue(&#123; el:document.getElementById(&#x27;app&#x27;) //或:&#x27;#app&#x27;&#125;);&lt;script/&gt; data : 通过Vue实例的data选项,继而配合v-model指令可以声明应用内需要双向绑定的数据,例如 : 12345678910&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; v-model=&quot;msg&quot; /&gt;&lt;script&gt;var vm = new Vue(&#123; el: &#x27;#app&#x27;, data: &#123; msg: &#x27;stay hungray,stay foolish ~&#x27; &#125;&#125;);&lt;/script&gt; 双括号(Mustache语法)是最基本的文本插值方法,它会自动将我们双向绑定的数据实时显示出来,例如 : 12345678910&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;&#123;&#123; message &#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt; var vm = new Vue(&#123; el: &#x27;#app&#x27;, data: &#123; message: &#x27;Hello Vue!&#x27; &#125;&#125;);&lt;/script&gt; 📖 参考,推荐书籍 : 《Vue.js实战》—— 梁灏 · 编著 《Vue.js从入门到项目实战》—— 刘汉伟 · 编著","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Vue","slug":"Vue","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Vue/"}]},{"title":"小爬虫:JDBookCrawler-V3.0","slug":"小爬虫-JDBookCrawler-V3-0","date":"2019-07-17T20:34:24.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.948Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/07/17/小爬虫-JDBookCrawler-V3-0/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/07/17/%E5%B0%8F%E7%88%AC%E8%99%AB-JDBookCrawler-V3-0/","excerpt":"","text":"爬虫项目笔记 : JDBookCrawler-V3.0简介 : JDBookCrawler 3.0的爬虫功能基于JDBookCrawler 2.0,前端设计参考项目springboot-beginner,简单点说v3.0就等于v2.0 + springboot,😅不尴尬嘿嘿嘿~ 开发环境 工具 版本或描述 OS Windows 10 JDK 1.8 IDE IntelliJ IDEA 2019.1 Maven 3.6.0 MySQL 8.0.11 本项目的数据库版本为8.0.11，请广大版本为5.0.0+的同学注意咯：可通过逐个复制表结构来创建该数据库哟 ~ 项目结构图12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485├─bookcrawler-v3.0│ │ crawler.sql│ │ pom.xml│ ││ ││ └─src│ └─main│ ├─java│ │ └─pers│ │ └─huangyuhui│ │ └─bookcrawler│ │ │ BookcrawlerApplication.java│ │ ││ │ ├─controller│ │ │ BookController.java│ │ ││ │ ├─crawler│ │ │ │ BookCrawlerTest.java│ │ │ ││ │ │ ├─dao│ │ │ │ BookDao.java│ │ │ ││ │ │ ├─mapper│ │ │ │ BookMapper.xml│ │ │ ││ │ │ ├─pojo│ │ │ │ Book.java│ │ │ ││ │ │ ├─resources│ │ │ │ db.properties│ │ │ │ log4j.properties│ │ │ │ mybatis-config.xml│ │ │ ││ │ │ ├─task│ │ │ │ BookProcessor.java│ │ │ ││ │ │ └─util│ │ │ FileUtils.java│ │ │ HttpUtils.java│ │ │ MyBatisUtils.java│ │ ││ │ ├─dao│ │ │ BookMapper.java│ │ │ BookMapper.xml│ │ ││ │ ├─pojo│ │ │ Book.java│ │ ││ │ └─service│ │ │ BookService.java│ │ ││ │ └─impl│ │ BookServiceImpl.java│ ││ └─resources│ │ application.properties│ ││ ├─static│ │ │ exist.txt│ │ ││ │ └─easyui│ │ │ jquery.easyui.min.js│ │ │ jquery.min.js│ │ ││ │ ├─css│ │ │ default.css│ │ │ demo.css│ │ ││ │ ├─js│ │ │ outlook2.js│ │ │ validateExtends.js│ │ ││ │ └─themes| | |│ │ |(略..)│ │| | │ └─templates│ bookList.html│ intro.html│ main.html│└─demonstration-images BookCrawler-V3.0-bookList.PNG BookCrawler-V3.0-Intro.PNG crawler包存放的是JDBookCrawler-v2.0，既3.0使用了2.0的爬虫功能，其本身仅加入了页面可视化功能 运行指南 crawler.sql : 数据库文件 1BookCrawler-v3.0/bookcrawler-v3.0/crawler.sql BookCrawlerTest.java : 爬虫启动程序 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233package pers.huangyuhui.bookcrawler.crawler;import pers.huangyuhui.bookcrawler.crawler.task.BookProcessor;import pers.huangyuhui.bookcrawler.crawler.util.FileUtils;/** * @project: bookcrawler * @description: 爬虫测试程序 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 7/11/2019-9:12 PM * @version: 2.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class BookCrawlerTest &#123;

GitHub工作流程可以简单地分为以下步骤 : 第一步 : 根据需求,从master拉出新分支(不区分功能分支或补丁分支) . 第二步 : 新分支开发完成后需要合并,谈论时,就需要向master发起一个pull request (PR) . 第三步 : Pull Request既是一个通知 : 让别人注意到你的请求,又是一种对话机制 : 让大家一起审核及讨论你的更改信息, 对话过程中可以不断修改提交信息并提交哟 . 第四步 : 当Pull Request通过审核后,继而可以与master合并啦 ! 成功重新部署后,原来你创建的那个分支就可以删除咯(先部署再合并也可以哟) . A Successful Git Branching Model Create a branch 当你在一个项目上工作时,你会在任何特定时间都有一堆不同的功能或想法,既而分支可以帮助你管理其工作流程. 在项目中创建分支等同于创建一个可以尝试新想法的环境. 你在新建分支上所做的更改并不会影响master分支(主分支),因此你可以自由地进行实验和提交更改信息,并且在你准备好与你正在协作的人进行审核此分支前,其并不会与master分支合并,既而也不会污染到主分支哟 ~ Tip : 分支是Git中的核心概念,整个GitHub流程都是基于它的. 注意点 : master分支中的任何内容始终都是可部署的. 因此,在处理或修复功能时,创建新分支是必要的操作,注意哟,分行名称应该是具有描述性的(如 : refactor-authentication,user-content-cache-key,make-retina-avatars),以便其他人理解正在进行的工作内容 . Add commits 创建分支后,就可以对其进行更改咯. 无论何时添加,编辑或删除文件,你最终都需要进行提交并将它们添加到你的分支,添加提交的过程会为你创建一份透明的工作历史记录,以便其他人可以了解你已完成的工作. 每个提交都有一个关联的提交信息描述,该信息是解释为何进行特定更改的描述. 此外,每个提交都被视为一个单独的变更单位,既而如果发现程序错误或想决定改变开发方向,你都可以回滚其更改的信息哟 . Tip : 提交时的描述消息很重要,因为Git会跟踪你的更改,然后在将它们推送到服务器后将其显示提交的描述信息. 通过编写清晰的提交描述信息,可以更轻松地让其他人跟进并提供反馈信息 . Open a Pull Request Pull Requests会启动有关你的提交的讨论. 任何人都可以确切地看到他们所接受的你的请求及将会合并哪些更改等信息. 你可以在开发过程中的任何时候使用拉取请求 : 如当你想要分享一些屏幕截图或一些想法,或遇到困难并需要帮助或建议时… 当你准备好想让某人审查你的工作时,可以通过在Pull Request消息中使用GitHub的@mention哟 ~ Tip : Pull Requests对于贡献开源项目和管理对共享存储库的更改非常有帮助. 如果你使用的是Fork＆Pull模式 : 则Pull Requests提供了一种可以通知项目维护者你希望他们考虑的更改的方法. 如果你使用的是共享存储库模式 : 则Pull Requests会在合并到主分支之前帮助启动代码审查和有关建议更改的对话 . Discuss and review your code 一旦Pull Request开始,审核你的更改信息的人员或团队可能会有问题或意见,其原因可能是因为编码风格与项目编码风格规定不符等等等 .. Pull Requests后的这个审核与探讨的过程是非常有意义的,如果有人评论你忘了做某事或代码中有错误,你可以在分支中修复它并继续推送其更改信息. GitHub将在统一的Pull Request视图中显示你的新提交及你可能收到的任何其他反馈信息 . Tip : Pull Request的评论是用Markdown编写的,因此你可以嵌入图片和表情符号,或使用预先格式化的文本块哟 ~ Deploy (实际开发中所需步骤) 一旦你的pull request请求被检查并且分支通过测试,你就可以通过重新部署继而在生产中验证它们. 若你发现你的分支出现了错误,则可以通过将现有的主服务器部署到生产环境中来回滚它 . Merge 现在你的更改已在生产中得到验证,是时候将代码合并到主分支中了啦. 合并后,Pull Requests会保留代码更改的记录,且它们是可被搜索到的,所以任何人都可以随时回头来查看,理解当初做出决定的解释信息 . Tip : 通过将某些关键字合并到Pull Request的文本中,可以将issues与代码相关联. 合并Pull Request请求后,相关问题也将关闭. 例如 : 输入关键字Closes #32后将关闭存储库中的第32个issue. 更多信息请查看帮助文章 : https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords 🙂

: Java爬虫之WebMagic简介 : WebMagic是一款简单灵活的爬虫框架,WebMagic的结构分为Downloader、PageProcessor、Scheduler、Pipeline四大组件,并由Spider将它们彼此组织起来. 这四大组件对应爬虫生命周期中的下载、处理、管理和持久化等功能. 而Spider则将这几个组件组织起来，让它们可以互相交互，流程化的执行，可以认为Spider是一个大的容器，它也是WebMagic逻辑的核心. Little book of WebMagic : http://webmagic.io/docs/zh/ WebMagic总体架构图如下所示 : WebMagic的四个组件DownloaderDownloader负责从互联网上下载页面,以便后续处理. WebMagic默认使用了Apache HttpClient作为下载工具 PageProcessorPageProcessor负责解析页面,抽取有用信息,以及发现新的链接,WebMagic使用Jsoup作为HTML解析工具,并基于其开发了解析XPath的工具Xsoup. 注意 : 在这四个组件中,PageProcessor对于每个站点每个页面都不一样,是需要使用者定制的部分 . SchedulerScheduler负责管理待抓取的URL,以及一些去重的工作. WebMagic默认提供了JDK的内存队列来管理URL,并用集合来进行去重. 也支持使用Redis进行分布式管理 . PipelinePipeline负责抽取结果的处理,包括计算、持久化到文件、数据库等.. WebMagic默认提供了输出到控制台和保存到文件两种结果处理方案. Pipeline定义了结果保存的方式,如果你要保存到指定数据库,则需要编写对应的Pipeline. 对于一类需求一般只需编写一个Pipeline . 用于数据流转的对象RequestRequest是对URL地址的一层封装,一个Request对应一个URL地址. 它是PageProcessor与Downloader交互的载体,也是PageProcessor控制Downloader唯一方式. 除了URL本身外,它还包含一个Key-Value结构的字段extra. 你可以在extra中保存一些特殊的属性,然后在其他地方读取,以完成不同的功能。例如附加上一个页面的一些信息等 . PagePage代表了从Downloader下载到的一个页面——可能是HTML,也可能是JSON或者其他文本格式的内容. Page为WebMagic抽取过程的核心对象,它提供一些方法可供抽取、结果保存等 .. ResultItemsResultItems相当于一个Map,它保存PageProcessor处理的结果,供Pipeline使用. 它的API与Map很类似,值得注意的是它有一个字段skip,若设置为true,则不应被Pipeline处理 . 控制爬虫运转的引擎-SpiderSpider是WebMagic内部流程的核心. Downloader、PageProcessor、Scheduler、Pipeline都是Spider的一个属性,这些属性是可以自由设置的,通过设置这个属性可以实现不同的功能. Spider也是WebMagic操作的入口,它封装了爬虫的创建、启动、停止、多线程等功能 .. 注意 : 一般来说,对于编写一个爬虫,PageProcessor是需要编写的部分,而Spider则是创建和控制爬虫的入口哟 ~ WebMagic入门程序获取我博客中的个人姓名信息,示例程序如下 : 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839package pers.huangyuhui.crawler.WebMagic_Demo;import us.codecraft.webmagic.Page;import us.codecraft.webmagic.Site;import us.codecraft.webmagic.Spider;import us.codecraft.webmagic.processor.PageProcessor;/** * @project: crawler_learning * @description: 第一个WebMagic小爬虫:爬取博客中的个人姓名 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 7/10/2019-3:54 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */public class FirstDemo implements PageProcessor &#123; //可以对爬虫进行一些配置,包括编码,抓取间隔,超时时间,重试次数等.. private Site site = Site.me(); @Override public void process(Page page) &#123; //解析Page,并将其结果存放到ResultItem中 page.putField(&quot;name&quot;, page.getHtml().css(&quot;aside#menu hgroup.introduce h5&quot;, &quot;text&quot;)); System.out.println(page.getResultItems().toString()); &#125; @Override public Site getSite() &#123; return site; &#125; //WebMagic默认将爬取结果输出到控制台 public static void main(String[] args) &#123; Spider.create(new FirstDemo()) .addUrl(&quot;https://yubuntu0109.github.io/&quot;) .run(); &#125;&#125; 程序运行结果 : 12345678910111219-07-13 15:58:11,084 INFO us.codecraft.webmagic.Spider(Spider.java:306) ## Spider yubuntu0109.github.io started!19-07-13 15:58:12,210 INFO us.codecraft.webmagic.downloader.HttpClientDownloader(HttpClientDownloader.java:86) ## downloading page success https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ResultItems&#123;fields=&#123;name=黄宇辉&#125;, request=Request&#123;url=&#x27;https://yubuntu0109.github.io/&#x27;, method=&#x27;null&#x27;, extras=null, priority=0, headers=&#123;&#125;, cookies=&#123;&#125;&#125;, skip=false&#125;get page: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/name: 黄宇辉 &lt;----------WebMagic默认将爬取结果输出到控制台19-07-13 15:58:17,405 INFO us.codecraft.webmagic.Spider(Spider.java:338) ## Spider yubuntu0109.github.io closed!

File file = new File(fileName); if (!file.isAbsolute()) &#123; file = new File(location, fileName); &#125; try &#123; fileItem.write(file); &#125; catch (Exception e) &#123; throw new IOException(e); &#125; &#125;&#125; 由源码可知,在使用Servlet3.0支持的上传文件功能时,若我们没有使用绝对路径,transferTo(File dest)方法会在相对路径前添加一个location路径 ! 继而影响了SpringMVC的MultipartFile的使用 . 解决方案使用绝对路径通过ResourceUtils.getURL(&quot;classpath:&quot;).getPath()获取项目的绝对路径,为防止项目路径中含有空格等特殊字符继而乱码,可以通过URLDecoder.decode(String s, Charset charset)对其进行解码. 1234//项目下存储头像的目录private final String uploadPath = &quot;/static/upload/friend_portrait/&quot;;//指定存储头像目录的完整路径(项目发布路径):若不使用绝对路径,则Spring boot会默认将上传的文件存储到临时目录中String dirPath = URLDecoder.decode(ResourceUtils.getURL(&quot;classpath:&quot;).getPath(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8) + uploadPath; 注 : 当我们使用ClassLoader()的getResource()方法获取路径时,获取到的路径是已被URLEncoder.encode(path,&quot;utf-8&quot;)编码了的,当路径中存在中文和空格时,它会对这些字符进行转换,继而得到的往往不是我们想要的真实路径,所以我们可以调用URLDecoder.decode(String s, Charset charset)方法进行解码,以便得到原始的中文及空格路径. 发送的时候使用encode(String s, Charset charset)编码,接收的时候使用URLDecoder.decode(String s, Charset charset)解码,按指定的编码格式进行编码、解码,可以保证不会出现乱码哟 ~ 12345//使用指定的编码机制将字符串转换为 application/x-www-form-urlencoded 格式URLEncoder.encode(String s, Charset charset)//使用指定的编码机制对 application/x-www-form-urlencoded 字符串解码URLDecoder.decode(String s, Charset charset) 修改location的值location可以理解为临时文件目录,可以通过配置location的值,使其指向我们的项目路径,继而来解决此问题. 只需在Spring Boot启动类中添如下代码 : 123456 @Bean MultipartConfigElement multipartConfigElement() &#123; MultipartConfigFactory factory = new MultipartConfigFactory(); factory.setLocation(&quot;/app/pttms/tmp&quot;); return factory.createMultipartConfig();&#125; 示例程序该上传文件的示例程序摘自我的Sping Boot-好友备忘录小项目,程序中使用绝对路径方案来解决上述问题,该程序具有参考与学习价值哟~ FriendController.java : 好友信息控制器 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253package pers.haungyuhui.memo.controller;import com.github.pagehelper.PageHelper;import com.github.pagehelper.PageInfo;import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;import org.springframework.util.ResourceUtils;import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;import pers.haungyuhui.memo.bean.Friend;import pers.haungyuhui.memo.service.FriendService;import pers.haungyuhui.memo.util.UploadFile;import javax.annotation.Resource;import java.io.FileNotFoundException;import java.net.URLDecoder;import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.List;import java.util.Map;/** * @project: memo * @description: 控制器-管理好友信息页面 * @author: 黄宇辉 * @date: 6/28/2019-8:25 PM * @version: 1.0 * @website: https://yubuntu0109.github.io/ */@Controller@RequestMapping(&quot;/memo&quot;)public class StudentController &#123;

Thymeleaf的主要目标是将优雅的自然模板带到开发工作流程中,并将HTML在浏览器中正确显示,并且可以作为静态原型,让开发团队能更容易地协作. Thymeleaf能够处理HTML,XML,JavaScript,CSS甚至纯文本 . 基础语法变量表达式 $&#123;&#125;使用方法 : 直接使用th:xx = &quot;$&#123;&#125;&quot;获取对象属性 12345678&lt;form id=&quot;userForm&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;id&quot; name=&quot;id&quot; th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.id&#125;&quot;/&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;username&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.username&#125;&quot;/&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.password&#125;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;div th:text=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div th:text=&quot;$&#123;user.username&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 选择变量表达式 *&#123;&#125;使用方法 : 首先通过th:object获取对象,然后使用th:xx = &quot;*&#123;&#125;&quot;获取对象属性 12345&lt;form id=&quot;userForm&quot; th:object=&quot;$&#123;user&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;id&quot; name=&quot;id&quot; th:value=&quot;*&#123;id&#125;&quot;/&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;username&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; th:value=&quot;*&#123;username&#125;&quot;/&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; th:value=&quot;*&#123;password&#125;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/form&gt; 链接表达式 @&#123;&#125;使用方法 : 通过链接表达式@&#123;&#125;直接拿到应用路径,然后拼接静态资源路径 12345&lt;!-- 访问项目路径下的user并传递id,name等参数 --&gt;&lt;a th:href=&quot;@&#123;~/user(id=1,name=demo)&#125;&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;script th:src=&quot;@&#123;/webjars/jquery/jquery.js&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;link th:href=&quot;@&#123;/webjars/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css&#125;&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; 片段表达式 ~&#123;&#125; ~&#123;viewName&#125; : 表示引入完整页面 ~&#123;viewName ::selector&#125; : 表示在指定页面寻找片段,其中selector可为片段名、jquery选择器等 ~&#123;::selector&#125; : 表示在当前页寻找 使用方法 : 首先通过th:fragment定制片段,然后通过th:replace填写片段路径和片段名 123456&lt;!-- /views/common/head.html--&gt;&lt;head th:fragment=&quot;static&quot;&gt; &lt;script th:src=&quot;@&#123;/webjars/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.js&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;!-- /views/your.html --&gt;&lt;div th:replace=&quot;~&#123;common/head::static&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 注意 : 由于默认拼接的路径为spring.thymeleaf.prefix = classpath:/templates/,所以在使用替换路径th:replace开头请勿添加斜杠,避免部署运行的时候出现路径报错 ! 消息表达式 &amp;#35;&#123;&#125;即通常的国际化属性 : &amp;#35;&#123;msg&#125;,用于获取国际化语言翻译值 1&lt;title th:text=&quot;#&#123;user.title&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/title&gt; 其它表达式在基础语法中,默认支持字符串连接、数学运算、布尔逻辑和三目运算等.. 1&lt;input name=&quot;name&quot; th:value=&quot;$&#123;&#x27;I am &#x27;+(user.name!=null?user.name:&#x27;NoBody&#x27;)&#125;&quot;/&gt; 常用语法迭代循环想要遍历List集合很简单,配合th:each即可快速完成迭代 1234&lt;div th:each=&quot;user:$&#123;userList&#125;&quot;&gt; 账号: &lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.username&#125;&quot;/&gt; 密码: &lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.password&#125;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 在集合的迭代过程还可以获取状态变量,只需在变量后面指定状态变量名即可,状态变量可用于获取集合的下标/序号、总数、是否为单数/偶数行、是否为第一个/最后一个 123456&lt;div th:each=&quot;user,stat:$&#123;userList&#125;&quot; th:class=&quot;$&#123;stat.even&#125;?&#x27;even&#x27;:&#x27;odd&#x27;&quot;&gt; 下标: &lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;stat.index&#125;&quot;/&gt; 序号: &lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;stat.count&#125;&quot;/&gt; 账号: &lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.username&#125;&quot;/&gt; 密码: &lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.password&#125;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 如果缺省状态变量名,则迭代器会默认帮我们生成以变量名开头的状态变量 xxStat 123456&lt;div th:each=&quot;user:$&#123;userList&#125;&quot; th:class=&quot;$&#123;userStat.even&#125;?&#x27;even&#x27;:&#x27;odd&#x27;&quot;&gt; 下标：&lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;userStat.index&#125;&quot;/&gt; 序号：&lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;userStat.count&#125;&quot;/&gt; 账号：&lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.username&#125;&quot;/&gt; 密码：&lt;input th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.password&#125;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 条件判断if语句其语法为 : th:if,通常用于动态页面的初始化 123&lt;div th:if=&quot;$&#123;userList&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;exist...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 如果想取反则可以使用unless 123&lt;div th:unless=&quot;$&#123;userList&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;not exist...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; switch语句其语法中需要th:switch与th:case结合使用,通常用于动态页面的初始化 12345&lt;div th:switch=&quot;$&#123;num&#125;&quot;&gt; &lt;span th:case=&quot;1&quot;&gt;num=1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span th:case=&quot;2&quot;&gt;num=2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span th:case=&quot;3&quot;&gt;num=3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div 日期格式化使用默认的日期格式(toString方法)并不是我们预期的格式 : Mon Dec 03 23:16:50 CST 2018 1&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; th:value=&quot;$&#123;user.createTime&#125;&quot;/&gt; 此时可以通过时间工具类&amp;#35;dates来将日期进行格式化为 : 2018-12-03 23:16:50 1&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; th:value=&quot;$&#123;#dates.format(user.createTime,&#x27;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&#x27;)&#125;&quot;/&gt; 内联写法 内联写法 : 解决 JS无法获取服务端返回的变量的尴尬 ~ 使用方法 : 标准格式为: [[$&#123;xx&#125;]],其可以读取服务端变量,也可以调用内置对象的方法.例如获取用户变量和应用路径:12345&lt;script th:inline=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; var user = [[$&#123;user&#125;]];` var APP_PATH = [[$&#123;#request.getContextPath()&#125;]]; var LANG_COUNTRY = [[$&#123;#locale.getLanguage()+&#x27;_&#x27;+#locale.getCountry()&#125;]];&lt;/script&gt; 内置对象七大基础对象 $&#123;&amp;#35;ctx&#125; : 上下文对象,可用于获取其它内置对象 $&#123;&amp;#35;vars&#125; : 上下文变量 $&#123;&amp;#35;locale&#125; : 上下文区域设置 $&#123;&amp;#35;request&#125; : HttpServletRequest对象 $&#123;&amp;#35;response&#125; : HttpServletResponse对象 $&#123;&amp;#35;session&#125; : HttpSession对象 $&#123;&amp;#35;servletContext&#125; : ServletContext对象 常用的工具类 &amp;#35;strings :字符串工具类 &amp;#35;lists : List工具类 &amp;#35;arrays : 数组工具类 &amp;#35;sets : Set工具类 &amp;#35;maps : 常用Map方法 &amp;#35;objects : 一般对象类,通常用来判断非空 &amp;#35;bools : 常用的布尔方法 &amp;#35;execInfo : 获取页面模板的处理信息 &amp;#35;messages : 在变量表达式中获取外部消息的方法,与使用&amp;#35;&#123;...&#125;语法获取的方法相同 &amp;#35;uris : 转义部分URL / URI的方法 &amp;#35;conversions : 用于执行已配置的转换服务的方法 &amp;#35;dates : 时间操作和时间格式化等 &amp;#35;calendars : 用于更复杂时间的格式化 &amp;#35;numbers : 格式化数字对象的方法 &amp;#35;aggregates : 在数组或集合上创建聚合的方法 &amp;#35;ids : 处理可能重复的id属性的方法 🙂thanks a lot : https://www.jianshu.com/p/908b48b10702","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Spring Boot","slug":"Spring-Boot","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Spring-Boot/"}]},{"title":"Spring Boot之整合视图层技术","slug":"Spring-Boot之整合视图层技术","date":"2019-06-26T22:33:47.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.696Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/06/26/Spring-Boot之整合视图层技术/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/06/26/Spring-Boot%E4%B9%8B%E6%95%B4%E5%90%88%E8%A7%86%E5%9B%BE%E5%B1%82%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF/","excerpt":"","text":"学习笔记 : Spring Boot之整合视图层技术简介 : 在目前的企业级应用开发中,前后端分离是趋势,但是视图技术还有一席之地.

Are you using MySQL’s utf8 charset in your databases? In this write-up I’ll explain why you should switch to utf8mb4 instead, and how to do it. UTF-8The UTF-8 encoding can represent every symbol in the Unicode character set, which ranges from U+000000 to U+10FFFF. That’s 1,114,112 possible symbols. (Not all of these Unicode code points have been assigned characters yet, but that doesn’t stop UTF-8 from being able to encode them.) UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding; it encodes each symbol using one to four 8-bit bytes. Symbols with lower numerical code point values are encoded using fewer bytes. This way, UTF-8 is optimized for the common case where ASCII characters and other BMP symbols (whose code points range from U+000000 to U+00FFFF) are used — while still allowing astral symbols (whose code points range from U+010000 to U+10FFFF) to be stored. MySQL’s utf8For a long time, I was using MySQL’s utf8 charset for databases, tables, and columns, assuming it mapped to the UTF-8 encoding described above. By using utf8, I’d be able to store any symbol I want in my database — or so I thought. While writing about JavaScript’s internal character encoding, I noticed that there was no way to insert the U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE (𝌆) symbol into the MySQL database behind this site. The column I was trying to update had the utf8_unicode_ci collation, and the connection charset was set to utf8. 123456789101112131415# just to emphasize that the connection charset is set to `utf8`mysql&gt; SET NAMES utf8; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)mysql&gt; UPDATE database_name.table_name SET column_name = &#x27;foo𝌆bar&#x27; WHERE id = 9001;Query OK, 1 row affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 1mysql&gt; SELECT column_name FROM database_name.table_name WHERE id = 9001;+-------------+| column_name |+-------------+| foo |+-------------+1 row in set (0.00 sec) The content got truncated at the first astral Unicode symbol, in this case 𝌆 — so, attempting to insert foo𝌆bar actually inserted foo instead, resulting in data loss (and possibly introducing security issues; see below). MySQL returned a warning message, too: 1234567mysql&gt; SHOW WARNINGS;+---------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Level | Code | Message |+---------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Warning | 1366 | Incorrect string value: &#x27;\\xF0\\x9D\\x8C\\x86&#x27; for column &#x27;column_name&#x27; at row 1 |+---------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+1 row in set (0.00 sec) Turns out MySQL’s utf8 charset only partially implements proper UTF-8 encoding. It can only store UTF-8-encoded symbols that consist of one to three bytes; encoded symbols that take up four bytes aren’t supported. Since astral symbols (whose code points range from U+010000 to U+10FFFF) each consist of four bytes in UTF-8, you cannot store them using MySQL’s utf8 implementation. This doesn’t just affect the 𝌆 character, but more important symbols like U+01F4A9 PILE OF POO (💩) as well. In total, that’s 1,048,575 possible code points you can’t use. In fact, MySQL’s utf8 only allows you to store 5.88% ((0x00FFFF + 1) / (0x10FFFF + 1)) of all possible Unicode code points. Proper UTF-8 can encode 100% of all Unicode code points. As shown above, this behavior can lead to data loss, but it gets worse — it can result in security vulnerabilities.MySQL’s utf8 encoding is awkwardly named, as it’s different from proper UTF-8 encoding. It doesn’t offer full Unicode support, which can lead to data loss or security vulnerabilities. MySQL’s utf8mb4Luckily, MySQL 5.5.3 (released in early 2010) introduced a new encoding called utf8mb4 which maps to proper UTF-8 and thus fully supports Unicode, including astral symbols. Switching from MySQL’s utf8 to utf8mb4 Step 1: Create a backupCreate a backup of all the databases on the server you want to upgrade. Safety first! Step 2: Upgrade the MySQL serverUpgrade the MySQL server to v5.5.3+, or ask your server administrator to do it for you. Step 3: Modify databases, tables, and columnsChange the character set and collation properties of the databases, tables, and columns to use utf8mb4 instead of utf8. For each database : ALTER DATABASE database_name CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci; For each table : ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci; For each column : ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name column_name VARCHAR(191) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci; (Don’t blindly copy-paste this! The exact statement depends on the column type, maximum length, and other properties. The above line is just an example for a VARCHAR column.)Since utf8mb4 is fully backwards compatible with utf8, no mojibake or other forms of data loss should occur. (But you have a backup, right?) Step 4: Check the maximum length of columns and index keysThis is probably the most tedious part of the whole upgrading process. When converting from utf8 to utf8mb4, the maximum length of a column or index key is unchanged in terms of bytes. Therefore, it is smaller in terms of characters, because the maximum length of a character is now four bytes instead of three. For example, a TINYTEXT column can hold up to 255 bytes, which correlates to 85 three-byte or 63 four-byte characters. Let’s say you have a TINYTEXT column that uses utf8 but must be able to contain more than 63 characters. Given this requirement, you can’t convert this column to utf8mb4 unless you also change the data type to a longer type such as TEXT — because if you’d try to fill it with four-byte characters, you’d only be able to enter 63 characters, but not more. The same goes for index keys. The InnoDB storage engine has a maximum index length of 767 bytes, so for utf8 or utf8mb4 columns, you can index a maximum of 255 or 191 characters, respectively. If you currently have utf8 columns with indexes longer than 191 characters,you will need to index a smaller number of characters when using utf8mb4. (Because of this, I had to change some indexed VARCHAR(255) columns to VARCHAR(191).) Section 10.1.11 of the MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual has some more information on this. Step 5: Modify connection, client, and server character setsIn your application code, set the connection character set to utf8mb4. This can be done by simply replacing any variants of SET NAMES utf8 with SET NAMES utf8mb4. If your old SET NAMES statement specified the collation, make sure to change that as well, e.g. SET NAMES utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci becomes SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci. Make sure to set the client and server character set as well. I have the following in my MySQL configuration file (/etc/my.cnf): 12345678910[client]default-character-set = utf8mb4[mysql]default-character-set = utf8mb4[mysqld]character-set-client-handshake = FALSEcharacter-set-server = utf8mb4collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci You can easily confirm these settings work correctly: 12345678910111213141516mysql&gt; SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name LIKE &#x27;character\\_set\\_%&#x27; OR Variable_name LIKE &#x27;collation%&#x27;;+--------------------------+--------------------+| Variable_name | Value |+--------------------------+--------------------+| character_set_client | utf8mb4 || character_set_connection | utf8mb4 || character_set_database | utf8mb4 || character_set_filesystem | binary || character_set_results | utf8mb4 || character_set_server | utf8mb4 || character_set_system | utf8 || collation_connection | utf8mb4_unicode_ci || collation_database | utf8mb4_unicode_ci || collation_server | utf8mb4_unicode_ci |+--------------------------+--------------------+10 rows in set (0.00 sec) As you can see, all the relevant options are set to utf8mb4, except for character_set_filesystem which should be binary unless you’re on a file system that supports multi-byte UTF-8-encoded characters in file names, and character_set_system which is always utf8 and can’t be overridden. Note: The default character set and collation can be configured at some other levels as well. Step 6: Repair and optimize all tablesAfter upgrading the MySQL server and making the necessary changes explained above, make sure to repair and optimize all databases and tables. I didn’t do this right away after upgrading (I didn’t think it was necessary, as everything seemed to work fine at first glance), and ran into some weird bugs where UPDATE statements didn’t have any effect, even though no errors were thrown. You could run the following MySQL queries for each table you want to repair and optimize: 123# For each tableREPAIR TABLE table_name;OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name; Luckily, this can easily be done in one go using the command-line mysqlcheck utility: 1$ mysqlcheck -u root -p --auto-repair --optimize --all-databases This will prompt for the root user’s password, after which all tables in all databases will be repaired and optimized. SummaryNever use utf8 in MySQL — always use utf8mb4 instead. Updating your databases and code might take some time, but it’s definitely worth the effort. Why would you arbitrarily limit the set of symbols that can be used in your database? Why would you lose data every time a user enters an astral symbol as part of a comment or message or whatever it is you store in your database? There’s no reason not to strive for full Unicode support everywhere. Do the right thing, and use utf8mb4. 🍻 ヾ(￣▽￣)ByeBye 🙂expressing thanks : https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4#utf8-to-utf8mb4","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"MySQL","slug":"MySQL","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/MySQL/"}]},{"title":"SSM项目:学生管理系统","slug":"SSM项目-学生管理系统","date":"2019-06-22T21:48:14.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.696Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/06/22/SSM项目-学生管理系统/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/06/22/SSM%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE-%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/","excerpt":"","text":"a simple student management system , created by SSM framework ~ 我的第二个SSM小项目 （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤～ 赶紧来学习吧 !

JSON 数据转换简介 : 为了实现浏览器与控制器Controller之间的数据交互,Spring提供了一个HttpMessageConverter&lt;T&gt;接口来完成此项工作. 该接口主要用于将请求消息中的数据转换为一个T的对象,并将类型为T的对象绑定到请求方法的参数中,或者将对象转换为响应消息传递给浏览器显示. Spring为HttpMessageConverter&lt;T&gt;接口提供了很多实现类,这些实现类可以对不同的类型的数据进行信息转换,其中MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter是Spring MVC默认处理JSON格式请求响应的实现类. 该实现类利用Jackson开源包读写JSON数据,将Java对象转换为JSON对象和XML文档,同时也可以将JSON对象和XML文档转换为Java对象 ! 示例程序 web.xml : 对Spring mvc的前端控制器等信息进行配置 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;web-app xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd&quot; version=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt; &lt;welcome-file-list&gt; &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.jsp&lt;/welcome-file&gt; &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt; &lt;!-- 配置Spring MVC前端控制器 --&gt; &lt;servlet&gt; &lt;servlet-name&gt;spring_mvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt; &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt; &lt;!-- 指定Spring MVC配置文件的路径 --&gt; &lt;init-param&gt; &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt; &lt;param-value&gt;classpath:springmvc-config.xml&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/init-param&gt; &lt;!-- 服务器启动后立即加载Spring MVC配置文件 --&gt; &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt; &lt;/servlet&gt; &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; &lt;servlet-name&gt;spring_mvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt; &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt; &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;&lt;/web-app&gt; springmvc-config.xml : Spring mvc配置文件 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns:context=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/context&quot; xmlns:mvc=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc/spring-mvc-4.3.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/context http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-4.3.xsd&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 定义Spring组件扫描器,指定需要扫描的包 --&gt; &lt;context:component-scan base-package=&quot;pers.huangyuhui.springmvc.controller&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 配置注解驱动 该配置会自动注册RequestMappingHandlerMapping和RequestMappingHandlerAdapter两个Bean, 并提供对读写XML和读写JSON等功能的支持. --&gt; &lt;mvc:annotation-driven/&gt; &lt;!-- 配置静态资源的访问路径,此配置中的文件将不被前端控制器所拦截(该目录存放jquery-1.12.4.js) --&gt; &lt;mvc:resources mapping=&quot;/js/&quot; location=&quot;/js/**&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 配置视图解析器 --&gt; &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver&quot;&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;prefix&quot; value=&quot;/WEB-INF/view/&quot;/&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;suffix&quot; value=&quot;.jsp&quot;/&gt; &lt;/bean&gt;&lt;/beans&gt; User.java : 用户信息 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839package pers.huangyuhui.springmvc.bean;/** * @project: springmvc_json * @package: pers.huangyuhui.springmvc.bean * @description: User information * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: 5/31/2019-1:44 PM * @version: 1.0 */public class User &#123; private String username; private String password; public String getUsername() &#123; return username; &#125; public void setUsername(String username) &#123; this.username = username; &#125; public String getPassword() &#123; return password; &#125; public void setPassword(String password) &#123; this.password = password; &#125; @Override public String toString() &#123; return &quot;User&#123;&quot; + &quot;username=&#x27;&quot; + username + &#x27;\\&#x27;&#x27; + &quot;, password=&#x27;&quot; + password + &#x27;\\&#x27;&#x27; + &#x27;&#125;&#x27;; &#125;&#125; index.jsp : 用于测试JSON交互的页面 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344&lt;%-- Created by IntelliJ IDEA.

MultipartResolver是一个接口对象,需要通过它的实现类CommonsMultipartResolver来完成文件的上传工作,在需要在spring mvc配置文件中定义MultipartResolver接口的Bean即可,其配置方式如下 : springmvc-config.xml1234567&lt;!-- 配置文件上传解析器:MultipartResolver --&gt;&lt;bean id=&quot;multipartResolver&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 设置请求编码格式 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;defaultEncoding&quot; value=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 设置允许上传文件的最大值(10MB),单位为字节 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;maxUploadSize&quot; value=&quot;20971520&quot;/&gt;&lt;/bean&gt; 注意: 因为MultipartResolver接口的实现类CommonsMultipartResolver内部是引用multipartResolver字符串获取该实现类对象并完成文件解析的,所以在配置CommonsMultipartResolver时必须指定该Bean的id为multipartResolver 文件上传案例 web.xml12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;web-app xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd&quot; version=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt; &lt;welcome-file-list&gt; &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.jsp&lt;/welcome-file&gt; &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt; &lt;!-- 配置Spring MVC前端控制器 --&gt; &lt;servlet&gt; &lt;servlet-name&gt;spring_mvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt; &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt; &lt;!-- 指定Spring MVC核心配置文件路径 --&gt; &lt;init-param&gt; &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt; &lt;param-value&gt;classpath:springmvc-config.xml&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/init-param&gt; &lt;!-- 使服务器启动后立即加载Spring MVC核心配置文件 --&gt; &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt; &lt;/servlet&gt; &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; &lt;servlet-name&gt;spring_mvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt; &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt; &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;&lt;/web-app&gt; Springmvc-config.xml : Spring MVC核心配置文件 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns:context=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/context&quot; xmlns:mvc=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc/spring-mvc-4.3.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd http://www.springframework.org/schema/context http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-4.3.xsd&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 定义组件扫描器,指定需要扫描的包 --&gt; &lt;context:component-scan base-package=&quot;pers.huangyuhui.file.controller&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 注解驱动 --&gt; &lt;mvc:annotation-driven/&gt; &lt;!-- 视图解析器 --&gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;viewResolver&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver&quot;&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;prefix&quot; value=&quot;/WEB-INF/view/&quot;/&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;suffix&quot; value=&quot;.jsp&quot;/&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;!-- 配置文件上传解析器:MultipartResolver --&gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;multipartResolver&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 设置请求编码格式 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;defaultEncoding&quot; value=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 设置允许上传文件的最大值(10MB),单位为字节 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;maxUploadSize&quot; value=&quot;20971520&quot;/&gt; &lt;/bean&gt;&lt;/beans&gt; upload.jsp : 文件上传页面 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637&lt;%-- Created by IntelliJ IDEA.

DataSource 接口简介 : 为了获取数据库连接对象(Connection),JDBC提供了javax.sql.DataSource接口,它负责与数据库建立连接,并定义了返回值为Connection对象的方法. 人们习惯性地把实现了该接口的类称为数据源,在数据源中存储了所有建立数据库连接的信息. 数据源中包含数据库库连接池,如果数据是水,数据库就是水库,数据源就是连接水库的管道,终端用户看到的数据集是管道里流出来的水. DBCP 数据源简介 : DBCP是数据库连接池(DataBase Connection Pool)的简称,是Apache组织下的开源连接池实现.其jar包中包含两个核心的类,分别是BasicDataSourceFactory和BasicDataSource. BasicDataSource : 为DataSource的实现类,主要包含设置数据源对象的方法.

DataBinder调用ConversionService组件进行数据类型转换,数据格式化等工作,并将ServletRequest对象中的消息填充到参数对象中. 调用Validator组件对已经绑定了请求消息数据的参数对象进行数据合法性效验. 效验完成后生成数据绑定结果BindingResult对象,Spring MVC会将BindingResult对象中的内容赋给处理方法的相应形参.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Spring MVC","slug":"Spring-MVC","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Spring-MVC/"}]},{"title":"MyBatis与Spring的整合","slug":"MyBatis与Spring的整合","date":"2019-05-22T21:23:28.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.688Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/05/22/MyBatis与Spring的整合/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/05/22/MyBatis%E4%B8%8ESpring%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B4%E5%90%88/","excerpt":"","text":"学习笔记 : Spring与MyBatis整合传统DAO方式的开发整合简介 : 采用传统DAO开发方式进行MyBatis与Spring框架的整合时,需要编写DAO接口以及接口的实现类,并且需要向DAO实现类中注入SqlSessionFactory,然后通过SqlSessionFactory创建SqlSession. 下面通过一个使用客户id查询数据表中客户信息的案例来演示该开发方式. customer.sql : 客户信息表 123456789# 客户信息表create table t_customer ( id INT(20) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, job VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, phone VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL ) db.properties : 数据库配置文件 12345678910111213##database configuration information#jdbc.driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driverjdbc.url=jdbc:mysql:xxxxxx?useSSL=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC&amp;allowPublicKeyRetrieval=truejdbc.username=xxxxxxjdbc.password=xxxxxx##DBCP configuration#jdbc.maxTotal=30 #最大连接数jdbc.maxIdle=10 #最大空闲连接数jdbc.initialSize=5 #初始化连接数 applicationContext.xml : Spring核心配置文件 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

RequestMapping 注解类型简介 : Spring通过@Controller注解找到相应的控制器类后,还需要知道控制器内部对每一个请求是如何处理的,这时就需要使用org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping注解类型,该注解类型用于映射一个请求或一个方法,其注解形式为@RequestMapping,可以使用该注解标注在一个类或方法上. 标注在方法上 : 该方法将成为一个请求处理方法,它会在程序接收到对应的URL请求时被调用. 标注在类上 : 该类中的所有方法都将映射为相对于类级别的请求,表示该控制器所处理的所有请求都被映射到value属性值所指的路径下.

Spring MVC具有如下特点 : 支持国际化. 支持多种视图技术. 灵活性强,易于与其它框架集成. 内置常见效验器,可以效验用户输入. 可自动绑定用户输入,并正确的转换数据类型. 使用基于XML的配置文件,编写后无需重新编译应用程序. 提供了一个前端控制器DispatcherServlet,使开发人员无须额外开发控制器对象. Spring MVC的工作流程Spring MVC的工作原理图如下所示. 第一个Spring MVC应用程序 第一步: 配置前端控制器 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;web-app xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;

&lt;display-name&gt;Hi_SpringMVC&lt;/display-name&gt; &lt;welcome-file-list&gt; &lt;welcome-file&gt;index.jsp&lt;/welcome-file&gt; &lt;/welcome-file-list&gt; &lt;servlet&gt; &lt;!-- 配置前端过滤器 --&gt; &lt;servlet-name&gt;spring_mvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt; &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt; &lt;!-- 初始化时加载配置文件 --&gt; &lt;init-param&gt; &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt; &lt;param-value&gt;classpath:springmvc-config.xml&lt;/param-value&gt; &lt;/init-param&gt; &lt;!-- 使容器在启动时立即加载Servlet --&gt; &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt; &lt;/servlet&gt; &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; &lt;servlet-name&gt;spring_mvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt; &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt; &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;&lt;/web-app&gt; 第二步: 创建Controller类 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031package pers.huangyuhui.springmvc.controller;import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.Controller;/** * @ClassName: FirstController * @Description: 控制器 * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: May 22, 2019 2:51:16 PM * */public class FirstController implements Controller &#123;

// 设置了逻辑视图名 modelAndView.setViewName(&quot;/WEB-INF/view/HiSpringMVC.jsp&quot;); return modelAndView; &#125;&#125; 第三步: 创建Spring MVC的配置文件,配置控制器映射信息 12345678910111213141516171819&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 配置处理器Handle,映射 `/firstController`请求 --&gt; &lt;bean name=&quot;/FirstController&quot; class=&quot;pers.huangyuhui.springmvc.controller.FirstController&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- 处理器映射器:将处理器Handle的name作为url进行查找 --&gt; &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- 处理器适配器:配置对处理器中handleRequest()方法的调用 --&gt; &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- 截图解析器 --&gt; &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver&quot; /&gt;&lt;/beans&gt; 注意: 在Spring 4.0以后,如果不配置处理器映射器,处理器适配器和视图解析器,也会使用Spring内部默认的配置来完成相应的工作呦~ 这里没有省略是为了更清晰地展示Spring MVC的工作流程. 第四步: 创建视图页面 123456789101112&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; pageEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;%&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hi SpringMVC ~&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;$&#123;msg &#125;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; 第五步: 启动Tomcat服务器,在浏览器中访问地址: http://localhost:8080/Hi_SpringMVC/FirstController 其效果图如下.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Spring MVC","slug":"Spring-MVC","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Spring-MVC/"}]},{"title":"MyBatis:动态SQL","slug":"MyBatis-动态SQL","date":"2019-05-16T15:01:11.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.688Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/05/16/MyBatis-动态SQL/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/05/16/MyBatis-%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81SQL/","excerpt":"","text":"学习笔记 : MyBatis之动态SQL简介 : MyBatis提供的对SQL语句动态组装的功能解决了开发人员在使用JDBC或其他的框架进行数据库开发时,需要手动拼装SQL的繁琐问题. 动态SQL元素动态SQL是MyBatis强大特性之一,MyBatis 3采用了功能强大的基于OGNL的表达式来完成动态SQL,其主要元素如下. &lt;if&gt; : 判断语句,用于单条分支判断. &lt;choose&gt;(&lt;when&gt;,&lt;otherwise&gt;) : 相当于Java中的swith…case…default语句,用于多条件分支判断. &lt;where&gt;,&lt;trim&gt;,&lt;set&gt; : 辅助元元素,用于处理一些SQL拼装,特殊字符问题. &lt;foreach&gt; : 循环语句,常用于in语句等列举条件中. &lt;bind&gt; : 从OGNL表达式中创建一个变量,并将其绑定到上下文,常用于模糊查询的sql中. 扩展 : OGNL是Object-Graph Navigation Language的缩写,它是一种功能强大的表达式语言,通过它简单一致的表达式语法,可以存取对象的任意属性,调用对象的方法,遍历整个对象的结构图,实现字段类型转化等功能.它使用相同的表达式去存取对象的属性.这样可以更好的取得数据. 应用案例下面通过一个操作客户信息的综合案例来学习SQL动态元素 (っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ ~ 客户信息表结构 12345678create table t_customer ( id INT(32) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, username VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, jobs VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL, phone VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL ) db.properties : 数据库配置文件 12345#database configuration informationjdbc.driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driverjdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://LOCALHOST/MyBatis?useSSL=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC&amp;allowPublicKeyRetrieval=truejdbc.username=rootjdbc.password=GoodTime mybatis-config.xml : MyBatis核心配置文件 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

Spring的JDBC模块负责数据库资源管理和错误处理,简化了开发人员对数据库的操作,从而将更多的精力投入到编写业务逻辑中. Spring JdbcTemplate 的解析针对数据库操作,Spring框架提供了JdbcTemplate类,该类是Spring框架数据抽象层的基础,Spring JDBC的核心类. 它继承自抽象类JdbcAccessor,同时实现了JdbcOperations接口. JdbcAccessor : 该类为子类提供了一些访问是数据库时使用的公共属性. JdbcOperations : 该接口定义了在JdbcTemplate类中可以使用的操作集合,包括增删改查等操作. Spring JDBC 的配置Spring JDBC模块主要由4个包组成,如下所示哟 ~ core(核心包) : 包含了JDBC的核心功能,包括JdbcTemplate,SimpleJdbcInsert,SimpleJdbcCall类,以及NamedParameterJdbcTemplate类. dataSource(数据源包) : 访问数据源的实用工具类,它有多种数据源的实现,可以在Java EE容器外部测试JDBC代码. object(对象包) : 以面向对象的方式访问数据库,它允许执行查询并将返回结果作为业务对象,可以在数据表的列和业务对象的属性之间映射查询结果. support(支持包) : 包含了core和object包的支持类,例如: 提供异常转换功能的SQLException类. 由此可知,Spring对数据库的操作都封装在这几个包中,Spring JDBC的配置是在配置文件applicationContext.xml中完成的哟 ~ 其模板如下所示 : 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 1: 配置数据源 --&gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;dataSource&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 数据库驱动 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;driverClassName&quot; value=&quot;com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- 连接数据库的url --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;url&quot; value=&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/xxxxxx&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- 连接数据库的用户名 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;username&quot; value=&quot;xxxxxx&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- 连接数据库的密码 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;password&quot; value=&quot;xxxxxx&quot; /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;!-- 2: 配置JDBC模板 --&gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;jdbcTemplate&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 默认必须使用数据源 --&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;dataSource&quot; ref=&quot;dataSource&quot; /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; &lt;!-- 3: 配置注入类 --&gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;xxxxxx&quot; class=&quot;xxxxxx&quot;&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;jdbcTemplate&quot; ref=&quot;jdbcTemplate&quot; /&gt; &lt;/bean&gt; ······&lt;/beans&gt; 定义JdbcTemplate时,需要将dataSource注入到JdbcTemplate中,而其它需要使用JdbcTemplate的Bean,也需要将JdbcTemplate注入到该Bean中(通常注入到Dao类中,在Dao类中进行与数据库的相关操作).

When it comes to your health,it seems that sitting too much may be as bad for you as smoking. 说到健康,久坐不起可能与抽烟一样对身体不利. If you sit for many hours a day in a traditional office job,you may be interested in a new study. This study suggests that you should get an hour of “brisk exercise” every day. 如果你从事传统办公室工作,每日都要坐几个小时,你可能会对一项新研究感兴趣.这项研究建议你每天都花一个小时做轻快运动. Reasearchers says this brisk exercise can help offices workers reduce their risk of an early death. Many offices workers spend a large part of their time seated and physically inactive. 研究人员表明,这样的轻快运动能够帮助上班族降低过早死亡的风险.很多上班族大部分时间都是坐着,没有过多行动. A lack of physical activity is linked to some 5.3 million deaths worldwide each year. The researchers say that makes a sedentary lifestyle more deadly than smoking. 全球每年530万例死亡都与缺乏体育锻炼有关.研究人员表示,久坐不动的生活方式比吸烟更致命. The new report said that a sedentary lifestyle can cause many diseases,including heart disease,diabetes and even some cancers. These diseases cost the world economy $67.5 billion every year. 最新的报道表明,静态的生活方式可能会导致很多疾病,其中包括心脏病,糖尿病,甚至是癌症.每年,全球在这些疾病上等的话费约有675美元. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests adults get 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week. In addition,CDC offcials advise adults to get an additional two hours of muscle strengthening per week. 美国疾病预防与控制中心建议成年人每周做150分钟有氧运动.此外,疾病防治中心官员建议成年人每周花两个小时做肌肉训练. Ulf Ekeslund is with the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences and the University of Cambridge. He was the lead writer of the report. Elf Ekeslund同时在挪威体育学院以及剑桥大学任职.他是该报告的首席作者. Ekelund says that “For many people who commute to work and have offices-based jobs,there is no way to escape sitting for prolonged periods of time.” Ekelund表示: “对于乘车上下班到办公室的很多人来说,都无可避免在办公室久坐.” He says he and the other reasearchers “cannot stress enough” the importance of getting exercise. Ekelund suggests going for a run in the morning,riding a bicycle to work,or taking a walk in the middle of the work day. 他表示他和其他研究人员一直都在强调锻炼的重要性. Ekelund建议人们晨跑,骑车上班,并在午间散步. An hour of physical activity is “ideal”,he adds. But if this is not possible,he suggests doing at least some exercise each day to reduce the risk of diease and an early death. 每天锻炼一小时是理想的,他补充道.但如果不能做到这点,他建议人们每天至少做些运动以降低患病以及过早死亡的风险. For the study,researchers looked at 13 earlier studies on the effect of inactivity. Study subjects were grouped according to the amount of activity they reported. The range of activity reported varied greatly——from less than 5 minutes a day to up 75 minutes a day. 此项研究中,研究人员参考了13个不活动带来影响的早期案例.根据他们报告的活动量对研究对象进行了分组.报告说,活动量的幅度差别非常大,从每天至少5分钟到每天75分钟不等. The study found that those who sat for eight hours a day,but got the suggested amount of exercise reduced their chances of dying at an early age. 研究发现每天至少坐8小时,但按照建议做了适量运动的人降低了过早死亡的风险. These people did better than those who sat less but were not active. 与那些坐的时间少但不做运动的人相比,这些人的情况更好. Ekelund says, “These has been a lot of concern about the health risks” linked “with today’s more sedentary lifestyle.” He says the message from his team is a positive one: it’s possible to reduce,or even eliminate these risks if we are active enough, “even without taking up sports or going to the gym.” Ekelund表示,如今很多健康问题都与静态生活方式有关.他表示他们团队带来的信息是非常积极的: 我们有可能降低甚至消除这些风险,只要我们经常活动,即使不从事体育运动或不去健身房.

SqlSessionFactory对象是线程安全的,它一旦被创建,在整个应用执行期间都会存在.如果我们多次地创建同一个数据库的SqlSessionFactory势必会耗尽数据库资源! 通常每一个数据库都会只对应一个SqlSessionFactory,所以在构建SqlSessionFactory时建议使用单例模式哟 ! SqlSessionSqlSession是MyBatis框架中另一个重要的对象,它是应用程序与持久层之间执行交互操作的一个单线程对象,其主要作用是执行持久化操作. 注意: 每一个线程都应该有一个自己的SqlSession实例,并且该实例是不能被共享的,同时SqlSession实例也是线程不安全的,因此其使用范围最好在一次请求或一个方法中,绝不能将其放在一个类的静态字段,实例或任何类型的管理范围中使用.使用后理应及时地关闭它 ! 配置文件主要元素结构图 映射文件官方简介 : MyBatis的真正强大在于它的映射语句,这是它的魔力所在.由于它的异常强大,映射器的XML文件就显得相对简单.如果拿它跟具有相同功能的JDBC代码进行对比,你会立即发现省掉了将近95%的代码! 俺喜欢简洁(✪ω✪) ~ 主要元素在映射文件中,&lt;mapper&gt;元素是映射文件的根元素,其它元素都是它的子元素,其子元素及其作用如下所示 : &lt;select&gt; : 映射查询语句,可自定义参数,返回结果等. &lt;insert&gt; : 映射插入语句,执行后返回一个整数,代表插入到条数. &lt;update&gt; : 映射更新语句,执行后返回一个整数,代表更新的条数. &lt;delete&gt; : 映射删除语句,执行后返回一个整数,代表删除的条数. &lt;sql&gt; : 用于定义一部分SQL,然后可被其它语句引用此SQL. &lt;cache-ref&gt;

Spring容器支持XML和Properties两种格式的配置文件.其前者最为常用哟! 在配置文件中,通常为一个Bean配置id或name和class两个属性即可,注意的是如果Bean中未指定id和name,则Spring会将class值当做id使用. Bean 的实例化简介 : 在Spring中,想要使用容器中的Bean时需要先将其实例化,其实例化的方式有三种,如下所示. 构造器实例化(最常用) : Spring容器通过Bean对应类中默认的无参构造方法来实例化Bean. 静态工厂方式实例化 : 将Bean配置中的class属性指定静态工厂类,然后使用factory-method属性来指定所创建的静态工厂方法. 实例工厂方式实例化 : 将需要实例化的Bean通过factory-bean属性指向配置的实例工厂,然后使用factory-method属性确定使用工厂中的具体方法.

Spring容器支持多种形式的Bean的装配方式,如基于XML的装配,基于Annotation的装配等.. 基于XML的装配Spring提供了两种基于XML的装配方式: 设值注入(Setter Injection)和构造注入(Constructor Injection). 在Spring实例化Bean的过程中,Spring首先会调用Bean的默认构造方法来实例化Bean对象,然后通过反射的方式调用setter方式来注入属性值.因此,设值注入要求一个Bean必须满足一下两点要求. Bean类必须提供一个默认的无参构造方法. Bean类必须为需要注入的属性提供对应的setter方法. 下面通过一个简单示例程序来展示基于XML的Bean的装配方式.

Hughes says the United States has laws to control monopolies——businesses that control too much of an industry. He wants the U.S. goverment to user those laws to help protect people from technology and social media companies. 休斯表示,美国有反垄断法律,垄断企业是指在某行业占据过多市场份额的企业.他希望美国政府利用这些法律帮助人们免受科技和社交媒体的侵害. His comments appeared Thursday in an opinion in The New York Times. 他的这番话出现在周四《纽约时报》的一篇评论文章中. Facebook Inc. quickly rejecte his call. Facebook公司很快拒绝了他的这一呼吁. Hughes once shared a room in college with Mark Zuckerberg,who later became Facebook’s chief executive officer. 休斯曾经在大学里和马克·扎克伯格同一寝室,后来马克·扎克伯格称为了Facebook的首席执行官. “We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies,no matter how well intentioned the leader of these of companies may be.Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American,” Hughes wrote. “我们是一个有着控制垄断传统的国家,不管这些公司的领导人的意图有多好.马克的权利是前所未有的,非美式的.” 休斯写到. More than 2 billion people worldwide currently use Facebook,The company also owns WhatApp,Messenger and Instagram. Each service has more than 1 billion users. 目前全世界有超过20亿人在使用Facebook,该公司还拥有What’s App,Messenger和Instagram三大平台.每项服务都有超过10亿的用户. Chris Hughes co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz at Harvard University in 2004,He left the company in 2007. He later said in a Linkedln post that he earned $500 million for his three years of work. 2004,克里斯·休斯,扎克伯格和达斯汀·莫斯科维茨在哈佛大学共同创办了Facebook.休斯于2007年离开了公司,他后来在领英(LinkedIn)的一篇帖子中说:三年的工作让它赚了5亿美元. It’s been 15 years since I co-founder Facebook at Harvard,and I haven’t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,he wrote. “从我在哈佛与他们联合创办Facebook已经有15年了,我已经有10年没有在这家公司工作了,但我感到愤怒和一定的责任.” 他写到. Hughes helped Barack Obama with his presidential election campaign‘s online strategy during the 2008 political campaign. 休斯在2008年大选中帮助巴卡拉·奥巴马制定了他的总统竞选网络策略. Over the past two years,several security and privacy scandals have hit Facebook. Investigators found that the company,working with a now-closed consulting business,called Cambridge Analytica,shared information about 87 million users. In 2016,the election campaign of then presidential candidate Donald Trump used that information to target its advertising to Facebook users. 在过去的两年里,Facebook涉及数起安全和隐私丑闻.调查人员发现,该公司与一家目前已经关闭的名为剑桥分析的咨询公司合作,共享了8700万用户的信息,2016年,当时的总统候选人唐纳特·特朗普的竞选团队利用这些信息,将其宣传目标对准了Facebook用户. Hughes helped to design what Facebook called the “News Feed.” He said that his team should have thought more carefully about how that might be used. 休斯帮助设计了Facebook的”新闻推送”,他说,它的团队应该更仔细地考虑如何使用这一技术. Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017,several months before the news came out about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. 休斯说,他最后一次见到马克伯格是在2017年的夏天,几个月后,剑桥分析公司的丑闻曝光. Mark is good,kind person. But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,Hughes said. 休斯说: “马克是个善良的好人.但令我愤怒的是,他太关注公司的发展导致他为了点击量而牺牲了网络安全和文明.” He also said he worries that the people around Zuckerberg always agree with him and never question his ideas. Zuckerbeg cannot be dismissed,so he has total control of the company. 他还说,他担心扎克伯格身边的人总是时顺从他,从不质疑他的想法,扎克伯格不能被解雇,所以他拥有公司的完全控制权. Hughes is not alone in asking for backup of Facebook. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for federal privacy rules and new laws to break up big tech companies. 休斯并不是唯一一个要求拆分Facebook的人.一些美国会议员呼吁制定联邦隐私法规和新法律来削弱大型科技公司. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said on Thursday he thinks Facebook needs to be broken up. He also called for the Justice Department’s antitrust to launch an investigation. 康涅狄克州参议员查德·不卢门撒尔周四表示,他认为Facebook需要拆分.他还呼吁司法部反垄断部门对其展开调查. In March,Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren promised to break up Facebook,Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google,if elected president.She thinks that action would help to support competition in the tech field. 今年三月,马萨诸塞州参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦承若,如果当选总统,她将拆分Facebook,亚马逊和谷歌,他认为,这一行动将有助于支持科技领域的竞争. Facebook rejected Hughes’call for WhatApp and Instagram to be made into separate businesses. The social media company said that attention should be directed instead on creating rules for the internet. Facebook拒绝了休斯将WhatApp和Instagram拆分成两家公司的提议.这家社交媒体公司表示,应该把注意力转向为制定互联网规则. Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don’t enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,a spokesperson said in the statement. “Facebook承认,成功伴随着责任.但拆分一家成功的美国公司并不能强化问责制,” 一位发言人在声明表示.

MyBatis 工作原理MyBatis框架执行流程图如下所示 : 从MyBatis框架执行流程图中可得知,MyBatis框架在操作数据库时,大体经过了8个步骤.下面对每一步进行详解哟 ~ 读取MyBatis配置文件mybatis-config.xml.其作为MyBatis的全局配置文件,配置了MyBatis的运行环境等信息,其中主要内容是获取数据库连接. 加载映射配置文件Mapper.xml.既SQL映射文件,该文件配置了操作数据库的SQL语句,需要在mybatis-config.xml中加载才能执行.mybatis-config.xml可以加载多个配置文件,每个配置文件对应数据库中的一张表. 构建会话工厂.通过MyBatis的环境等配置信息构建会话工厂SqlSessionFactory. 创建SqlSession对象.由会话工厂创建SqlSession对象,该对象中包含了执行SQL的所有方法. MyBatis底层定义了一个Executor接口来操作数据库,它会根据SqlSession传递的参数动态地生成需要执行的SQL语句,同时负责查询缓存的维护. 在Executor接口的执行方法中,包含一个MappedStatement类型的参数,该参数是对映射信息的封装,用于存储要映射的SQL语句的id,参数等.. Mapper.xml文件中一个SQL对应一个MappedStatement对象,SQL的id既是MappedStatement的id. 输入参数映射,其过程类似于JDBC编程中对preparedStatement对象设置参数的过程. 输出参数映射,其过程类似于JDBC编程中对结果的解析处理过程.

Spring 框架优点Spring 具有简单,可测试和松耦合等特点,从这个角度出发,Spring可适用于服务器端/任何Java应用的开发. 非侵入式设计 方便耦合,简化开发 支持AOP 支持声明式事务处理 方便程序的测试 方便集成各种优秀的框架 降低Java EE API的使用难度 Spring 核心容器Spring框架的主要功能是通过其核心容器来实现.Spring框架提供了两种核心容器,分别是BeanFatory和ApplicatoinContext. BeanFactoryBeanFactory为基础类型的Ioc容器,简单的说就是一个管理Bean的工厂,它主要负责初始化各种Bean,并调用它们的生命周期方法. ApplicationContextApplicationContext是BeanFactory的子接口,也称为应用上下文,不仅包含了BeanFactory的所有功能,还添加了对国际化,资源访问,事件传播等方面的支持.有两种创建ApplicatoinContext接口实例的方法. 通过ClassPathXmlApplicationContext创建 通过类路径classPath中寻找指定的XML配置文件,找到并装载完成ApplicationContext的实例化工作. 通过FileSystemXmlApplicatoinContext创建 通过指定的文件系统路径(绝对路径)中寻找指定的XML配置文件,找到并装载完成ApplicationContext的实例化工作. 依赖注入依赖注入的作用就是在使用Spring框架创建对象时,动态地将其所依赖的对象注入Bean组件中,其实现方式通常有两种,一种是属性setter方法注入,另一种是构造方法注入. 属性setter方法注入指Spring容器使用setter方法注入被依赖的实例.通过调用无参的构造器或无参静态工厂方法实例化Bean后,调用该Bean的setter方法,即可实现基于setter方法的依赖注入. 构造方法注入指Spring容器使用的构造方法注入被依赖的实例.基于构造方法的依赖注入通过带参数的构造方法来实现,每个参数代表着一个依赖.

As of Tuesday,all but one of 56 Endgame critiques on the Rotten Tomatoes website were rated as positive. 截止到周二,烂番茄网站上出现的56篇有关《终局》的评论中,除了一篇之外 其余都是正面评论. USA Today’s Brain Truitt called the three-hour film “glorious“. He especially praised the time-travel part of the story. He said the movie includes returns to past happenings,which will please fans of superheroes like Iron Man and Thor. 《今日美国》的布莱恩·特鲁伊特称这部三个小时的电影”极其壮观”.他特别赞扬了故事中穿越时空的部分.他说,这部电影中出现的对过去发生的事情的回顾,可以取悦像钢铁侠和雷神这样的超级英雄的粉丝. But “it’s also a singular story”,Truitt said. 但是,”它也是一个奇艺非凡的故事,”特鲁伊说. The final film begins where last year’s Avengers: Infinity War ended,when several beloved heroes appeared to turn to dust. 最后一部电影以去年的《复仇者联盟3:无限战争》结束的地方为开端,当时几位深爱观众喜爱的英雄人物几乎都化为了灰烬. CNN’s Brain Lowry said Endgame is a winning finish. 美国广播电视公司的布莱恩·洛瑞表示,《复仇者联盟:终局》是胜利的结束. “The filmmakers have sought to reward movie-goers with a spectacle that’s epic in every way,” Lowry said. “电影制作人试图用史诗般的场面回报电影观众.” 洛瑞说. He alse wrote that there are several real surprises in the movie.and a lot of humor and emotional moments,as well. 他还写到,电影中还有一些惊喜,以及很多幽默和令人感动的时刻. A.O.Scott of The New York Times said the movie provides a “sense of an ending,” even though many characters are expected to return in future films. 《纽约时报》的斯科特说,这部电影让人们得到一种”结局感”,尽管很多角色都有望在未来的电影中回归. Scott wrote,”We’ve lived with these character and actors playing them for more than 10 years.” He added: “For the most part,it’s nice to see them again,and a little sad to say goodbye.” 斯科特写道: “我们和这些角色以及扮演他们的演员生活在一起已经有10多年.” 他补充道: “在很大程度上,在此见到他们很高兴,但说再见时有点伤感.” Esther Zuckerman of Thrillist agrees. “Endgame reinforces that there’s still a beating heart beneath all the machinery,” she wrote. 推尔名单网站的埃斯特·祖克曼对此表示赞同.”《终局》强化了一个概念,既所有机器下面仍有一颗跳动的心,” 她写到. Not everyone is pleased with the new film,Barry Herhz of Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper calls Avengers: Endgame “shockingly boring.” 然而,并不是每个人都对这部电影感到满意.加拿大《环球邮报》的巴里·赫兹称《复仇者联盟:终局》”无聊至极.” Movie experts say the film may break records for opening weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada. That record now stands at $257.7 million,set by Avengers: Infinity War. 电影专家表示,这部电影可能会打破美国和加拿大首映周末票房的记录.目前记录是由《复仇者联盟3:无限战争》创下的2.577亿美元.

Cookie objectCooke是一种会话技术,它用于将会话过程中的数据保存到用户的浏览器中,从而使浏览器和服务器可以更好地进行数据交互.Cookie在浏览器和服务器之间的传输过程示例图如下 : Cookie application显示用户上次访问时间案例描述 : 当用户请求LastAccessServlet时,服务器会调用HttpServletResponse接口的addCookie(Cookie cookie)方法,该方法会在发送给浏览器的HTTP响应消息中增加一个Set-Cookie头字段,将创建的Cookie对象作为Set-Cookie头字段的值传递给浏览器.示例程序如下 : 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950@WebServlet(&quot;/LastAccessServlet&quot;)public class LastAccessServlet extends HttpServlet &#123; private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public LastAccessServlet() &#123; super(); &#125; protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; response.setContentType(&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot;); String lastAccessTime = null;// 最后一次登录的时间 // 获取所有cookie,并将其存放到数组中 Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies(); for (int i = 0; cookies != null &amp;&amp; i &lt; cookies.length; i++) &#123; // 如果cookie的名称为lastAccess,则获取其对应的cookie值 if (&quot;lastAccess&quot;.equals(cookies[i].getName())) &#123; lastAccessTime = cookies[i].getValue(); break; &#125; &#125; // 判断是否存在名称为lastAccess的cookie if (lastAccessTime == null) &#123; response.getWriter().println(&quot;the first to visit this page !&quot;); &#125; else &#123; response.getWriter().println(&quot;the time of last visited : &quot; + lastAccessTime); &#125; // 创建cookie,并将当前时间作为名为lastAccess的cookie的值 String currentTime = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;YYYY-MM-dd—&gt;hh:mm:ss&quot;).format(new Date()); Cookie cookie = new Cookie(&quot;lastAccess&quot;, currentTime); // 设置Cookie对象在客户端的存活时长,默认值为 -1 cookie.setMaxAge(60); // 设置该Cookie项的有效目录路径 cookie.setPath(&quot;/Cookie-Session_basic&quot;); // 发送cookie到客户端 response.addCookie(cookie); &#125; protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; doGet(request, response); &#125;&#125; Session objectCookie技术可以将用户的信息保存在各自的浏览器中,并且可以在多次请求下实现数据的共享.但是,如果传递的信息比较多,使用Cookie技术显然会增加服务器端程序处理的难度.这时,可以使用Session实现,Session是一种将会话数据保存到服务器端的技术.当浏览器访问Web服务器时,Servlet容器就会创建一个Session对象和ID属性,当客户端后续访问服务器时,只要将标识号传递给服务器,服务器就能判断出该请求是哪个客户端发送的,从而选择与之对应的Session对象为其服务.需要注意的是 : 由于客端户需要接收,记录,回送Session对象的ID,因此,通常情况下,Session是借助Cookie技术来传递ID属性的 ! HttpSession APISession是与每个请求消息紧密相关的,HttpServletRequest接口中定义了用于获取Session对象的getSession()方法,该方法有两种重载形式. 1234// 根据传递的参数来判断是否创建新的HttpSession对象public HttpSession getSession(boolean create);// 在相关的HttpSession对象不存在时总是创建新的HttpSession对象public HttpSession getSession(); Session超时管理为了解决不再使用的HttpSession对象会在Web服务器中因积累过多从而导致Web服务器内存耗尽的问题,Web服务器采用了超时限制的办法来判断客户端是否还在继续访问.在会话过程中,会话的有效时间可以在web.xml文件中设置,其默认值由Servlet容器定义.如果想使站点内的所有Web应用程序都起作用,可以配置&lt;Tomcat directory&gt;\\conf\\web.xml文件,如下所示 : 1234567&lt;!-- ==================== Default Session Configuration ================= --&gt; &lt;!-- You can set the default session timeout (in minutes) for all newly --&gt; &lt;!-- created sessions by modifying the value below. --&gt; &lt;session-config&gt; &lt;session-timeout&gt;30&lt;/session-timeout&gt; &lt;/session-config&gt; Session application实现购物车案例描述 : 购物车的的实现流程如下图所示,当用户使用浏览器访问某个网站的图书列表页面时,如果购买某一本书,那么首先会判断书籍是否存在,如果存在就加入购物车,跳转到购物车中所购买图书的列表页,否则,返回图书列表页面.

&#125;&#125; 为了查看HttpSessionListener和ServletRequestListener监听器的运行效果,可以新建一个index.jsp页面,当运行Tomcat服务器第一次访问index.jsp时,Web容器除了为这次请求创建了ServletRequest对象外,还创建了与这个浏览器对应的HttpSession对象,当这两个对象在被创建时,Web容器会调用监听器MyServeltListener中相应的方法,当Web服务器完成这次请求后,ServletRequest对象会随之销毁.需要注意的是: 如果刷新index.jsp页面,会再次触发ServletRequestListener监听器接口中的方法,继而创建新的ServletRequest对象,但不会创建新的HttpSession对象,这是因为Web容器会为每次访问请求创建一个新的ServletRequest对象,而对于同一个浏览器在会话期间的后续访问是不会再创建新的HttpSession对象的. 案例-统计当前在线人数案例描述 : 通常情况下,当一个用户在进入某个网站时服务器就会为其创建一个HttpSessionListener对象,当用户离开网站时HttpSessionListener对象就会别销毁.因此,可以使用实现了HttpSessionListener接口的监听器来统计网站的在线人数. login.jsp : 用于显示当前在线人数. 12345678910111213&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot;

Filter过滤器实现了javax.servlet.Filter接口.在Filter接口中定义了三个方法,其代表Filter的生命周期,如下所示 : 123456// 用于初始化过滤器init(FilterConfig filterConfig);// 客户端请求时被调用(Filter所有的工作都集中在此方法中)doFilter(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response,FilterChain chain);// 在Web应用程序卸载时被调用destory(); Filter annotation简介 : Servlet3.0提供@WebFilter注解将一个实现了javax.servlet.Filter接口的类定义为过滤器,继而当我们在Web应用中使用过滤器时无需在web.xml文件中配置Filter映射 ! 注解示例-拦截用户的所有请求1234@WebFilter(filterName=&quot;/MyFilter&quot; , urlPatterns= &quot;/*&quot;)public class MyFilter implements Filter &#123; ···&#125; 注解示例-拦截不同方式的访问请求描述 : 根据被Servlet容器调用的方式来拦截指定的资源.其调用方式如下所示 : 1234567891011121314package javax.servlet;/** * Enumeration of filter dispatcher types. * * @since Servlet 3.0 */public enum DispatcherType &#123; FORWARD, INCLUDE, REQUEST, ASYNC, ERROR&#125; 下面以FORWARD(如果目标资源是通过RequestDispatcher的forward()方法访问时,该过滤器将会被调用)为例,演示Filter对转发请求的过滤效果.

HttpServletResponseHttpServletResponse接口继承自ServletResponse,用于封装HTTP响应消息.由于HTTP响应消息分为 : 状态行,响应消息头,消息体三部分,因此,在HttpServletResponse接口中定义了向客户端发送响应状态码,响应消息头,响应消息体的方法. HttpServletResponse application中文输出乱码问题由于计算机中的数据都是以二进制形式存储的,因此,当传输文本时,就会发生字符和字节之间的转换.字符与字节之间是通过查码表完成的,将字符转换为字节的过程称为编码,相反称为解码.如果两者使用的码表不一致就会导致乱码问题.可通过以下示例程序中的方法解决此问题. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728@WebServlet(&quot;/SetCharsetServlet&quot;)public class SetCharsetServlet extends HttpServlet &#123; private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public SetCharsetServlet() &#123; super(); &#125; protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; // 第一种解决乱码的方式 // response.setCharacterEncoding(&quot;utf-8&quot;); // response.setHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot;); // 第二种解决乱码的方式 response.setContentType(&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot;); PrintWriter printWriter = response.getWriter(); printWriter.write(&quot;中文&quot;); &#125; protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; doGet(request, response); &#125;&#125; 网页定时刷新并跳转在HTTP中定义了一个Refresh头字段,他可以通知浏览器在指定的时间自动刷新并跳转到其它页面.示例程序如下. 12345678910111213141516171819202122@WebServlet(&quot;/SetHeaderServlet&quot;)public class SetHeaderServlet extends HttpServlet &#123; private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public SetHeaderServlet() &#123; super(); &#125; protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; // 实现网页的定时刷新并跳转 response.setHeader(&quot;Refresh&quot;,&quot;5;URL=https://yubuntu0109.github.io&quot;); &#125; protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; doGet(request, response); &#125;&#125; 请求重定向在某些情况下,针对客户端的请求,一个Servlet类可能无法完成全部工作.这时,可以使用请求重定向来完成.所谓的请求重定向,指的是Web服务器接受到客户端的请求后,可能由于某些条件限制,不能访问当前请求URL所指的Web资源,而是指定了一个新的资源路径,让客端户重新发送请求. 用户登录界面 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; pageEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;%&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;login in&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;User login interface&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;SendRedirectTest&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;User name&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Password&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;userpassword&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;login in&quot;/&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; 登录成功页面 1234567891011121314&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; pageEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;%&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;success&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot; &gt;weclome&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;success to login in !&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; 编写处理用户登录请求的Servlet程序 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031@WebServlet(&quot;/SendRedirectServlet&quot;)public class SendRedirectServlet extends HttpServlet &#123; private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public SendRedirectServlet() &#123; super(); &#125; protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; // 设置编码 response.setContentType(&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot;); // 使用HttpServletRequest对象的getParameter()方法获取用户名及密码 String name = request.getParameter(&quot;username&quot;); String password = request.getParameter(&quot;userpassword&quot;); if (&quot;YUbuntu0109&quot;.equals(name) &amp;&amp; &quot;demo&quot;.equals(password)) &#123; response.sendRedirect(&quot;Redirection/welcome.jsp&quot;); &#125; else &#123; response.sendRedirect(&quot;login.jsp&quot;); &#125; &#125; protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException &#123; doGet(request, response); &#125;&#125; HttpServletRequestHttpServletRequest接口继承自ServletRequest,用于封装HTTP请求消息.由于HTTP请求消息分为 : 请求行,请求消息头,请求消息体三部分,因此,在HttpServletRequest接口中定义了获取请求行,请求头,请求消息体的相关方法.

A 2018 study has found a lifetime of regular exercise and activity can slow down the aging process. 2018年的一项研究发现,在人的一生中,定期锻炼和参加活动可以减缓衰老过程. Researchers at Britain’s University of Birmingham and King’s Collage London say that getting older should not necessarily mean becoming more weak or sick. Their research shows that a commitment to a life of movement and exercise my help us live ont only longer,but also healthier. 英国伯明翰大学和伦敦国王学院的研究人员说,年龄的增长不一定意味着变得更加虚弱.他们的研究表明,坚持运动和锻炼可以使我们的寿命加长,而且身体会更健康. For their study,the researchers looked at two groups. 关于他们的研究,研究人员观察了两个小组. The first group was made up of 125 non-professional cyclists between the ages of 55 to 79. This group included 84 healthy men and 41 healthy women. We will call this group the “cyclists”. 第一组由125名年龄在55至79岁之间的非职业自行车手组成.该组包括84名健康男性和41名女性.我们将这个组称为: “自行车运动组.” Researchers then found 130 people to make up a second group. Within this group,75 people were aged 57 to 80. The other 55 were between the ages of 20 and 36. The people in this group were also healthy,but they did not exercise regularly. We will call this group the “non-exercisers”. 研究人员随后找了130人组成第二组.在这一组中,有75人年龄在57岁至80岁之间.其他55人年龄在20岁至36岁之间.这一群体的人也很健康,但他们没有定期锻炼.我们将这个小组称为: “非运动组”. Smokers,heavy drinkers of alcohol and people with other health issues were not included in the study. 吸烟者,酗酒者以及有其他健康问题的人士未参与此次研究. Then,researchers gave both groups a series of tests. They testd their muscle mass,muscular strength,percentage of body fat,cholesterol levels and the strength of their immune system. And male participants had their testosterone levels checked. 然后,研究人员对这两组进行了一系列的测试.他们测试他们的肌肉质量,肌肉力量,身体脂肪的百分比,胆固醇水平和他们的免疫系统的强度.还检查了男性参与者的睾酮水平. The the researchers compared the result of the two groups. 然后研究人员比较了两组的结果. Result showed that the cyclists did not experience body changes usually equated with a normal aging process. For example,they did not lose muscle mass or strength. Also,their body fat and cholesterol levels did not increase with age. 结果表明,骑自行车的人没有经历身体变化,通常等同于正常的老化过程.例如: 他们的肌肉质量或力量没有减少.此外,他们的身体脂肪和胆固醇指标并没有随着年龄增加而上升. The male cyclists’ testosterone levels had also remained high. Researchers say this may mean that they avoided at least one major symptom of male menopause. 男性骑行者的睾酮水平也一直很高.研究人员说: 这可能意味着他们至少避免了男性更年期的一个主要症状. The reseachers also found something they had not expected. The study showed that the immune systems of the cyclists did not seem to age either. For this,they looked at an organ called the thymus. The thymus makes immune cells called T-cells. 研究人员还发现他们没有预料的事情.该研究表明,骑自行车的免疫系统似乎也没有老化.为此,他们观察了一个称为胸腺的器官.胸腺制造的免疫细胞称为T细胞. The University of Arizona’s biology department explains on its website that T-cells are a type of white blood cell and are made in our bone marrow. 亚利桑那大学生物系在其网站上解释说,T细胞是一种白血球,在我们的骨髓中生成. As the article says: “There are two types of T-cells in your body: Helper T-cells and Killer T-cells. Killer T-cells do the work of destorying the infected cells. The Helper T-cells coordinate the attack.” 正如文章所说: “你体内有两种类型的T细胞: 辅助型T细胞和杀伤型T细胞. 杀伤型T细胞的工作是消灭感染的细胞.辅助型T细胞协调攻击.” Starting at about the age of 20,the thymus of most people starts to get smaller. It also starts to make fewer T-cells. 从大约20岁开始,大多数人的胸腺开始变小.所产生的T细胞也开始相应的减少. Howerver,in this study,the T-cell production by the thymuses of the cyclists had not slowed down with age. They were making as many T-cells as those of a young person. 然而,在这项研究中,骑自行车者的胸腺产生的T细胞没有随着年龄增加而减慢.他们正在制造与年轻人一样多的T细胞.

She write: “Hippocrates in 400 BC said that exercise is man’s best medicine,but his message has been lost over time and we are an increasingly sedentary society.” 她写到: “公元前400年希波克拉底说: 运动是人类最好的药物,但随着时间的流逝,他的话渐渐被大家所遗忘,我们正处在一个日益就久坐的社会.” Professor Stephen Harridge is director of the Center of Human &amp; Aerospace PhysiologicalSciences at King’s College London. He addressed the common question of what came first——the chicken or the egg? In this case,the question became,”Which camej first——the healthy behavior or the good health?” 斯蒂芬哈里教授是伦敦国王学院人体与航天生理学中心主任.他解释了一个老生常谈的问题——先有鸡还是先有蛋?在这种情况下,这个问题变成了: “有着健康行为,会有一个健康的身体.还是有了健康的身体才会进行健康的行为.” When talking about the findings of the study,he said “the cyclists do not exercise because they are healthy,but that they are healthy because they have been exercising for such a large portion of their lives.” 在谈到这项研究的结果时,他说: “骑自行车的人之所以健康,并不是因为他们身体健康,而是因为他们“在生命的大部分时间里一直在锻炼.” The researchers advise us all to find an exercise that we like and to make physical activity a priority in our lives. 研究人员建议我们所有人都要找到自己喜欢的运动,并将身体活动作为我们生活中的优先事项.

Scientists are now looking inside living brains to tell if depression might speed aging. The scientists report that some of the signs they have found are worrisome. 随着年龄增长,人的记忆力和思维能力也随之减退.科学家正在研究活人大脑的内部情况,以判断抑郁症是否会加速大脑老化.科学家报告称,他们发现一些迹象令人十分担忧. Depression has long been linked to some cognitive problems. Depression late in life even may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Yet how depression might harm the ability to remember things and things and think clearly is not yet known. 长期以来,抑郁症就与一些认知障碍相关联.在晚年,抑郁症甚至可能增加患增加阿尔兹海默病的风险.而然,关于抑郁症会如何损害记忆力及清晰的思维能力,目前尚不清楚. One pssibility : Brain cells communicate by sending messages across connections called synapses. Generally,good cognition is linked to more and stronger synapses. With a weakening of congnitive ability,those connections slowly shrink and die. But unitl recently,scientists could count synapses only in brain tissue collected after the person dies. 一种可能是: 脑细胞间通过被称为突触的连接进行交流.一般来说,良好的认知能力表明突触数量多且强健.随着认知能力的退化,突触会慢慢萎缩并消亡.但直到最近,科学家还仅能通收集逝者的大脑组织来计算出突触的数量. Yale University scientists used a new method to study the brains of living people. They discovered that patients with depression had a lower density of synapses than healthy people of the same age. 耶鲁大学科学家采用了一种新方法来研究活人的大脑.他们发现,抑郁症患者的突触密度比同龄的健康人群要低. The lower the density,the more severe the signs of depression. Yele University neuroscientist Irna Esterlis says this is especially true of problems with loss of interest in activities patients once enjoyed. She spoke at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 突触密度越低,患抑郁症的迹象越严重.耶鲁大学神经学家伊琳娜·埃斯特曾在美国科学促进会的一次会议发言上说: 病人对曾经喜欢的活动失去兴趣的问题尤其如此. Esterlis was not studying just older adults,but people of all ages,including those too young for any cognitive changes to be noticeable. She was working from a theory that early damage can build up. 埃斯特里并不仅仅是在研究老年人,而是所有年龄段的人群,包括那些非常年轻,无法注意到任何认知变化的人群.她的研究建立在”早起伤害会不断积累”这一理论上. “We think depression might be accelerating the normal aging,”she said. 她说: “我们认为抑郁症可能正加速正常衰老.” Her studies are small. To prove if depression really does increase the risk of cognitive problem as we age would require more investigation. Jovier Evans is a scientist with the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. He proposed a study of synaptic density on larger numbers of people as they get older,to see if and how it changes over time in those with and without depression. 她进行的是小型研究.要证明随着年龄的增长,抑郁症确实会增加认知障碍的风险需要进行更多的调查.乔维尔·埃文斯是美国国家心理健康研究所的科学家.他提出一项研究: 针对更多的人群,研究他们随着年龄的增长,突触密度的变化,以此来判断在那些患抑郁症和无抑郁症的人群中,随着时间的推移,突触密度是否改变以及如何改变. Eaterlis has announced plans for a larger study to do that. Volunteers would be injected with a radioactive substance that links up to a protein in the vesicles,or storage containers,used by synapses. Then each volunteer would be given an imaging test,known as a PET scan. During the test,areas with synapses light up,enabling researchers to see how many are in different parts of the brain. 埃斯特里已宣布要进行大规模对的研究计划.志愿者将注射放射性物质,该物质与囊泡中的蛋白质或突触使用的储存容器相连.然后,每位志愿者将进行影像检查,也就是PET扫描.检查期间,突触区域会亮起来,这样研究人员就能够看到大脑的不同部位有多少突触. Esterlis said there are no medications that target synapse damage. 埃斯特里表示目前没有专门治疗突触损伤的药物. Doctor Mary Sano directs the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in New York. She was not involved in the new research. 玛丽·萨诺医生是纽约西奈山阿尔茨海默病研究中心的负责人.她没有参与这项新研究. Sano warned that normal cognitive aging is complex process that involves other health problems,such as heart disease. It might be that depression does not worsen synaptic weakening. It could just makes the problem more noticeable,she said. 萨诺提醒说,正常的认知衰退是个复杂的过程,设计其他健康问题,比如心脏病.也有可能抑郁症不会加速突触退化.她说,抑郁症可能只是让问题更显而易见. With depression “at any age,there’s a hit on the brain.

TagSupport类实现了该接口,简化了程序的编写. BodyTag 接口 在实现自定义标签时,其可以根据需要对标签体的内容进行处理后再向浏览器输出. 案例-实现一个传统自定义标签描述 : 开发一个显示IP地址的自定义标签 编写完成标签功能的标签处理器类 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031package pers.huangyuhui.tag.handler;import java.io.IOException;import javax.servlet.jsp.JspException;import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagSupport;/** * @ClassName: IpTag * @Description: 传统标签处理器 * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: Apr 25, 2019 4:06:28 PM * */public class IpTag extends TagSupport &#123; private static final long serialVersionUID = -8446674958888389920L; @Override public int doStartTag() throws JspException &#123; String IP = pageContext.getRequest().getRemoteAddr(); try &#123; pageContext.getOut().write(&quot;访问用户的IP地址为 : &quot; + IP); &#125; catch (IOException e) &#123; e.printStackTrace(); &#125; return super.doStartTag(); &#125;&#125; 编写TLD文件 123456789101112131415161718192021222324&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;taglib xmlns=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-jsptaglibrary_2_0.xsd&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- 标签库的版本号 --&gt; &lt;tlib-version&gt;1.0&lt;/tlib-version&gt; &lt;!-- 标签库的名称 --&gt; &lt;short-name&gt;TraditionalTag&lt;/short-name&gt; &lt;!-- 标签库的URI --&gt; &lt;uri&gt;https://yubuntu0109.github.io&lt;/uri&gt; &lt;!-- 注册一个自定义的标签 --&gt; &lt;tag&gt; &lt;!-- 指定自定义标签的注册名称 --&gt; &lt;name&gt;ipTag&lt;/name&gt; &lt;!-- 指定标签的标签处理器类 --&gt; &lt;tag-class&gt;pers.huangyuhui.tag.handler.IpTag&lt;/tag-class&gt; &lt;!-- 指定标签的类型 --&gt; &lt;body-content&gt;empty&lt;/body-content&gt; &lt;/tag&gt;&lt;/taglib&gt; 编写JSP文件,并导入和使用自定义标签 1234567891011121314&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; pageEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;%&gt;&lt;%-- 导入自定义的标签库描述符文件 --%&gt;&lt;%@taglib uri=&quot;https://yubuntu0109.github.io&quot; prefix=&quot;yu&quot; %&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;测试自定义标签&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;yu:ipTag/&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; 简单标签 SimpleTag 接口 SimpleTag接口中的方法和传统标签中定义的签名有所区别,但是功能却基本一致,例如: 都实现了给标签处理器传递pageContext对象和父标签处理器对象的功能.而且JSP容器执行简单标签处理器的顺序也和执行传统标签处理器的顺序一致.简单标签处理器的执行流程如下所示: 1JSP容器实例化标签处理器类 ——&gt; setJspContext() ——&gt; setParent() ——&gt; 设置属性的setter方法 ——&gt; setJspBody() ——&gt; doTag() JspFragment 类 JSP容器在处理简单标签时,会把标签体内容用一个JspFragment对象表示,并调用标签处理器对象的setJspBody()方法将JspFragment对象传递给标签处理器对象,标签开发者可以根据需要调用JspFragment对象的方法来决定是否输出标签体,或者循环多次输出标签体等.其中JspFragment的invoke(Write out)方法是简单标签开发中最重要的一个方法,它用于控制如何执行标签体的内容. SimpleTagSupport 类 该类实现了SimpleTagSupport接口,继而使得简单标签处理器的编写变得简化. 案例-实现一个自定义简单标签描述 : 自定义简单标签,实现重复执行标签体的功能. 编写标签处理器类 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233package pers.huangyuhui.tag.handler;import java.io.IOException;import javax.servlet.jsp.JspException;import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.JspFragment;import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.SimpleTagSupport;/** * @ClassName: SimpleIterate * @Description: 简单标签处理器 * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: Apr 24, 2019 4:52:19 PM * */public class SimpleIterate extends SimpleTagSupport &#123;

Having success and being able to meet one’s goals requires knowledge,a sense of direction,hard work and resources. Some people might add to that list luck,connections and perhaps a strong belief in yourself. 获得成功以及达到某人的目标需要知识,方向感,努力付出和资源.一些人也许会将幸运,关系和自信加入其中. We accomplish our goals one step at a time,doing a little each day. So,using your day effectively is important. 我们一步步完成自己的目标,每天完成一点.所以高效率地过好每天很重要. On many websites——from Forbes magazine and Fast Commpany to health and physical fitness sites——productivity experts share advice on how to achieve your career and life goals. Most of the experts agree on one thing: Starting your day on the right foot is most important. 很多网站上,从福布斯杂志,快递公司到健康网站,专家都分享如何能够实现职业和生活目标的建议.很多专家都同意一点: 每一天开一个好头最重要. Collected from these websites,here are five ideas on how to start your day off right. 根据这些网站整理出五点,关于如何做到开门大吉. Get up an hour early. 第一: 早起一小时. People who get up early in the morning have a jump on the day. For starters,they’s awake! And some studies show that our willpower and attention span are strongest in the morning. In fact,the morning may be the most productive part of your day. 早起的人们在那一天就已经领先一步.首先,他们已经清醒了.一些研究显示,我们的意志力和注意力在早上最集中.事实上,早晨可能是你一天当中效率最高的时候. In American English,we like to say,”The early bird gets the worm.” Here,if you’re a bird,the worm is the reward. So,this expression means that people who rise up early have a head start and,therefore,are more likely to succeed. 在美式英语中,我们喜欢说: “早起的鸟儿有虫吃.” 如果你是一只鸟,虫子就是你早起的回报.这个表达是指早起的人们捷足先登,因此更可能成功. Inventor,philosopher and writer Benjamin Franklin would probably agree. Americans like to use Franklin’s memorable expressions. One of them is “Early to bed,early to rise,makes a man healthy,wealthy and wise.” 发明家,哲学家及作家的本杰明·富兰克林可能会同意这一点.美国人喜欢引用富兰克林的经典语录.其中一条是: “早睡早起会让人聪明,富有及智慧.” Of course,there are exceptions. People who are “night owls“ do their best work and their best thinking at night. 当然也有例外.”夜猫子”型的人在晚上的工作效率最高.思维最活跃. Drink a glass of with lemon juice. 第二: 喝一杯柠檬水. While your coffee is being prepared or waiting for your tea water to heat up,drink a glass of water with lemon juice. 当你在煮咖啡或蒸茶时,先喝一杯柠檬水. Why? Health experts say that drinking a combination of lemon juice and water first thing in the morning jump-starts the body’s metabolism. Not only does it jump start your body’s cells,but this kind keeps them moving throughout the day. 为什么呢? 健康专家表示,早上先喝一杯柠檬会激活身体的新陈代谢.不仅会激活你身体的细胞,还会让这些细胞整天保持运转. Don’t answer emial or jump into social media as soon as you get up. 第三: 一起床不要先回邮件或查看社交媒体. Your coffee or tea is ready. So,you decide to look at your email quickly or open up your Facebook account. Well,don’t. This is a great way to forget about the day ahead. 你的咖啡或茶煮好了.你决定先快速浏览一遍邮件或打开你的社交账户.不要这么做.这会让你忘记这是全新的一天. We’ve all done it. You see a Facebook post from a friend you haven’t seen in a long time. He is angry about some political issue and the heated discussion pulls you in. Before you know it,an hour has passed,you’re angry with lawmakers and it’s not even nine in the morning yet! You hurry out the door so as not to be later for work. This is not the best way to start your day. 我们都这么做过.你看到很久不见的朋友发了一条状态.他对某个政治问题感到很气愤,然后拉你进入热烈的讨论.不知不觉中,一个小时过去了,你对立法者感到很生气,这时早上还不到九点.你为了避免上班迟到而急匆匆地冲出门外.这绝不是开启一天的最佳方式. Exercise ! Some people may disagree with this one. Exercising in the morning may not be for everyone. Some people like to exercise after work or at night. 一些人可能不同意.在早上锻炼并不适合所有人.一些人喜欢下班后或晚上锻炼. Physical fitness experts and trainers often suggest some form of exercise in the morning because the middle of the day is busy time for most people. By the day’end,you may not have the time or energy to exercise. How many times have you finished work and said to yourself. “I’m too tired to exercise! I’ll do it tomorrow.” 健身专家和教练通常会建议在早上做一些形式的运动,因为白天对大多数人来说就是最繁忙的时候.白天结束后,你可能就没有时间或精力去运动了.有多少次你下班后告诉自己: “我太累了,不能再锻炼了,明天再去锻炼吧!” Exercising in the morning prevents that from happening. 在早上锻炼可以防止这一点. Think about your day…at night. 第五,在晚上思考你白天做的事情. Meditate,visualize——whatever you call it——take time at the day to think back on all the things that have happened. Give thanks,if you want. And spend a little time to think about tomorrow. Some people who talk about “living in the present” may criticize this. But it may help you to prepare if you take a few minutes to think about what you need to do the next day. 冥想,思考——无论你将其称为什么—— 一天结束前花点时间想想今天发生过的事.感恩这一天.然后花点时间想想明天.一些坚持”活在当下”的人可能会批判这一点.但如果你能花几分钟想想第二天需要做些什么,可能会帮助你提前进行准备继而提高效率. Also,know that your day will probably change. You probably won’t have time to do everything you planned. But that’s fine. If you did one thing, that means you are one step closer in reaching one of your goals. And if you follow this advise,at least you’ve already gotten your exercise out of the way ! 同时要知道,这一天也许会发生某些变化,你也许没有时间做完你所计划的所有的事,但这也没关系.如果你做完一件事,就离你完成这个目标近了一步.如果你遵循这些建议,至少你不会忘了锻炼.

public static void main(String[] args) &#123; StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(&quot;Hello&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;before change: &quot; + sb); change(sb); System.out.println(&quot;after change: &quot; + sb); &#125; private static void change(StringBuffer stringBuffer) &#123; stringBuffer.append(&quot; world !&quot;); &#125;&#125; 程序运行结果 12before change: Helloafter change: Hello world ! 探究结论 从上述程序运行结果可知sb所指的对象的值被改变了!那么我们是否就可以认为Java中的对象作为参数传递时,传递的是该对象的引用呢 ? 那我们再来看第二个示例程序. 第二个示例程序12345678910111213141516public class test &#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(&quot;Hello&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;before change: &quot; + sb); change(sb); System.out.println(&quot;after change: &quot; + sb); &#125; private static void change(StringBuffer stringBuffer) &#123; stringBuffer = new StringBuffer(&quot;Hi&quot;); stringBuffer.append(&quot; world !&quot;); &#125;&#125; 程序运行结果 如果上面的推论:(Java中对象作为参数传递时,实际传递的是该对象的引用)是正确的,那么在调用change函数后,原对象的值应该会被改变,既变为:Hi World !,但是,该程序的运行结果如下 !!! 12before change: Helloafter change: Hello 可知原对象(sb)的值并没有被改变,这是为什么呢? 下面让我们来分析一下其中的原因吧嘿嘿 ~ 结论分析 当我们执行StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(&quot;Hello&quot;)时,我们便创建了一个指向新建对象new StringBuffer(&quot;Hello&quot;)的引用sb,如下所示. 1sb ——————&gt; [Hello] 在第二个示例程序中,当我们调用change函数后,实际上,形参stringBuffer也指向了实参sb所指的对象! 如下所示. 1sb ——————&gt; [Hello] &lt;—————— stringBuffer 那么当我们执行stringBuffer.append(&quot;world!&quot;)后,便通过对象的引用(stringBuffer)修改了对象的值,使之修改成了: Hello world !,如下所示: 1sb ——————&gt; [Hello world !] &lt;—————— stringBuffer 但是在第二个示例程序中的change函数中,我们又新建了一个对象:new StringBuffer(&quot;Hi&quot;)(该操作实际上是在内存中开辟了一块在原对象地址之外的新区域),这让形参stringBuffer实际指向了这个新建的对象,并将新对象的值设置为了Hi world !,如下所示: 12sb ——————&gt; [Hello]stringBuffer ——————&gt; [Hi World !] 综上所述,可以得出结论: 在Java中,当对象作为参数传递时,实际上传递的是一份&quot;引用&quot;的拷贝 ! 总结在Java中, = 不能看成一个赋值语句,因为它并不是把一个对象赋给另一个对象的过程,它的执行过程实质上是将右边对象的地址传给了左边的引用,使得左边的引用指向了右边的对象.Java表面上看起来没有指针,但它的引用实质上就是一个指针,引用里面存放的并不是对象,而是存放该对象的地址,使得该引用指向了该对象.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"VOA:One in Five Deaths Linked to Unhealthy Diet","slug":"VOA-One-in-Five-Deaths-Linked-to-Unhealthy-Diet","date":"2019-04-23T09:06:07.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.728Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/23/VOA-One-in-Five-Deaths-Linked-to-Unhealthy-Diet/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/04/23/VOA-One-in-Five-Deaths-Linked-to-Unhealthy-Diet/","excerpt":"","text":"One in Five Deaths Linked to Unhealthy DietIn 2017,eleven million deaths worldwide were linked to people eating diets high in sugar,salt and processed meat. 2017年,全国范围内有1100个死亡案例与摄入含糖,含盐,加工肉制品最高的食物有关. Those foods were partly to blam for heart disease,cancer and diabetes,a new study found. 上述食物是导致心脏病,癌症,糖尿病的部分原因,这是一项新研究的发现. The study is called the Global Burden of Disease,It followed eating trends in 195 countries 1990 to 2017. The findings were reported in the publication The Lancet. 该研究名为”全国疾病负担研究”.该研究在1990-2017年间跟进了195个国家的饮食趋势.该研究的发现成果以报告的形式发布在了《柳叶刀》杂志上. Researchers considered 15 dietary elements,such as diets low in fruits,vegetables,whole grains and milk. They also looked at diets high in red meat,processed meat,sugar-sweetend drinks and sodium. 研究人员考量了15中饮食元素,比如水果,蔬菜,全谷类,牛奶含量少的食谱.研究人员还考量了红肉,加工肉制品,含糖饮料,含钠量高的食谱. The study found that Uzbekistan had the highest percentage of diet-related deaths. 该研究发现: 乌兹别斯坦因食谱而导致死亡的比例是最高的. Israel had the lowest proportion of diet-related deaths, while the United Stated reted 43rd in the study. 以色列则恰恰相反,美国则名列第43位. Consumption of foods such as nuts and seeds,milk and whole gains was on average too low,the researchers found. 研究人员发现,平均来看,坚果,种子,牛奶,全谷类的摄入太低. Chris Murrary is director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington,which led the work. 克里斯·默里是华盛顿大学健康指标和评估研究所的负责人,他也是这项研究的负责人. “Poor diet is reponsible for more deaths than any other risk factor in the world,”he said. 他表示,”食谱不健康是导致死亡案例增加的罪魁祸首,比其他的风险都要致命.” The study found people are only 12 percent of the recommended amount of nuts and seeds——an average intake of 3 grams a day. For good health,experts say,you should eat 21 grams of nuts and seeds every day. 研究发现,人们摄入坚果和种子的总量只达到了推荐摄入量的12%——平均每天只有3克.多位专家表示,为了保持身体健康,每天应该摄入21克的坚果和种子类食物. The study also found that people drank more than 10 times the recommened amount of sugary drinks. 该研究还返现:含糖饮料的摄入量是推荐摄入量的10倍以上. Another study published in January suggested an “ideal diet” for the health of people and the planet would a doubling of the consumption of nuts,fruits,vegetables and legumes. Such a diet would also include reducing by half the amount of meat and sugar consumed. 一月份发布的另一个研究提出了一份”理想食谱”来保证人类的身体健康,而且全国范围内的所有人都应该加倍摄入坚果,水果,蔬菜,豆类食品.这样的健康食谱还应该包括将肉类和糖分摄入量减少一半.

That is what Dr.Katie Bouman said two years ago during her TED talk called “How to take a picture of a black hole.” 这是两年前凯蒂·布曼博士在她的TED演讲《如果拍一张黑洞的照片》中所说的话. Bouman is 29 years old. She received her doctoral degrees in computer science and enginnering from the Masschusetts Institute of Technology. She later became a postdoctoral researcher with the international Event Horizon Telescope,or EHT,project. The project scientists produced a black hole image from data collected from a series of telecopes around the world. Together,they formed an Earth-sized “virtual” telescope——on powerful enough to do what had once seemed impossible. 布曼今年29岁,她在麻省理工学院获得了计算机科学和计算机工程博士学位.后来,她成为了国际事件视界望远镜(简称EHT)项目的博士后研究院.研究该项目的科学家们从世界各地各种望远镜收集的数据中的得出了一张黑洞图像.他们一起组成了一个地球大小的虚拟望远镜,这个望远镜强大到足以让他们完成曾经看起来不可能完成的任务. This week,the team of scientists,led by Sheperd S.Doeleman of Harvard University,released to the public the first-ever image of a black hole. 本周,由哈佛大学的谢泼德S.杜勒曼领导的科学家团队向公众发布了史上第一张黑洞图片. Soon after,another image was spreading over ssocial media and the news. It’s showed a smiling Bouman with the black hole image on her computer screen. She wrote on Facebook, “Watching in disbelief as the first image I ever made of a black hole was in the process of being reconstructed.” 不久之后,另一个照片在社交媒体和新闻上传播开来.照片上布曼在微笑,她后面的电脑屏幕上是黑洞的图像.她的脸书上写到: “看着我制作的第一张黑洞图片正在重新,这简直难以置信.” Bouman led a team that helped create an algorithm,or set of computer processes that turned the huge amout of telescopic data into one image. 布曼领导者的团队帮助创建了一种算法,或一组计算机处理程序,其能将望远镜观察到的大量数据转换为一张图像. Bouman quickly became a symbol for woman in science. 布曼很快成为了科学界女性的象征. One especially pupular Twitter post showed a side-by-side picture of Bouman with hard drives of black hole image data next to another woman scientist: Margarget Hamilton. In 1969,Hamilton helped write on-board computer code for NASA’s Apollo space program. 一条特别受欢迎的推特帖子展示了一张布曼与另一位女科学家玛格丽特·汉密尔顿并列的照片,布曼的硬盘里存有黑洞图像数据.1969年,汉密尔顿为美国宇航局的阿波罗太空计划编写了随行对计算机代码. Twitter user Tammy Emma Pepin wrote of Bouman,”Here’s to more women in science——getting their credit and being remembered in history.” 推特用户塔米·艾玛·佩平这样评论布曼: “让更多的科学女性获得荣誉,并被载入史册.” And Twitter user Pooja Chandrakekar,who recently completed her studies in engineering at Harvard,wrote, “So many young girls will see Dr.Katie Bouman as an inspiration and go on to make their own discoveries in space,physis,and computer science. A historic moment not just for science,but for women in science.” 推特用户普贾·钱德拉斯卡最近最哈佛大学工程学系毕业,她写到: “很多年轻女性都因凯蒂·布曼博士而大受鼓舞,决定在太空,物理和计算机科学领域做深入研究.这不仅是科学界的历史性时刻,也是科学领域中女性的历史时刻.” But Boman herself quickly noted that she was not the only one responsible for the image off the black hole. She posted on Facebook, “No one algorithm or person made this image,it required the amazing talent of a team of scientists from around the globe and years of hard work…” 但布曼本人很快指出,她并不是黑洞图像的唯一功臣. 她在Facebook上写到: “并不是什么算法或者人制作了这幅图像.这幅图像的的问世得益于世界各地的科学家团队的惊人才能和多年的辛勤工作···” After the press event Wednesday,Bouman spoke with members of the media. She said she is looking forward to developing more algorithms and methods that will help lead to an even better,sharper image of a black hole. 周期三的新闻发布会后,布曼对媒体说,她期待着开发更多的算法和方法,以帮助生成一幅更好,更清晰的黑洞图像. Bouman will begin her teaching career at the California Institute of Technology later this year. 今天晚些时候,布曼将在加州理工学院开始地她的教学生涯.

Which is more popular —— coffee or tea ?If you are on Team Coffee,you team may be ahead. 如果你站在咖啡队,那就加一分. The well-known U.S. coffee shop Starbucks just opened its largest store in the land of tea: China! 美国著名的咖啡店星巴克在茶叶之国中国开了一家最大的门店! The Shanghai Starbucks is 2,700 square meters and employs more than 400 people. 上海星巴克占地2700平方米,员工400多人. But nw for the health question: Is coffee good for us ? 但现在从健康出发,咖啡对我们有好处吗? There have been many studies on the health benefits of coffee. Recently,researchers at the University of Southampton&#39;s Faculty of Medicine in Great Britain looked at results from 201 observational coffee studies and 17 clinical trial of coffee 有很多关于咖啡对健康的益处的研究.最近,英国南安普顿大学医学院的研究人员对咖啡进行了研究,他们观察了201项观测性研究和17项临床试验的结果. With this “umbrella review“ researchers wanted to find a clear answer on whether coffee is good for us or not. 在”撒网式研究”的帮助下,研究人员想找到一个明确的答案: 咖啡对我们是否有益. They discovered that coffee drinkers had a lower risk of heart and liver disease and some cancers. Coffee drinkers also had a lower risk of dying from stroke. 它们发现和咖啡的人患心脏病,肝病和一些癌症的风险较低.喝咖啡的人死于中风的风险也较低. However,their findings are uncertain. The researchers could not prove coffee was the cause of these lowered risks. 然而,他们的发现还不确定,研究人员不能证明咖啡是降低这些风险的原因. One of the researchers of this umbrella review is Robin Poole. Poole’s team notes that their umbrella review included mainly observational data. Therefore,they could not prove any cause and effect relationship. “撒网式研究”的其中一位研究人员是罗宾·普尔.普尔的团队注意到,它们的”撒网式研究”主要是观测数据.因此他们无法证明任何因果关系. The National Institutes of Health in the United States define an “observational uncontrolled study” as a study where “researchers simply watch what happens to a series of people in one group.”,There is no control group. 根据美国国家卫生研究院的定义,”不受控制的观测性研究”指的是”研究人员仅观察一组人中一部分人的情况”的研究.这种研究没有试验控制组. Still,researchers found that the benefits of moderate coffee drinking seem to outweght the risks. Their report says drinking coffee “was more often associated with benefit than harm.” 不过,研究人员发现,适度应用咖啡的好处似乎大于风险.它们的报告指出,喝咖啡”好处多于坏处”. Poole calls these findings “Handline benefits.” 普尔称这些发现为”看得见的益处”. There are some headline benefits such as a lower risk of dying from any cause,a lower risk of dying from heart disease and stroke and lower risk of developing heart diease in the first place. 有一些看得见的益处,比如降低死亡的风险,降低死于心脏病和中风的风险,以及降低患早期心脏病的风险.对于这些结果,每天喝三到四杯咖啡就可以带来最大的好处. Poole means that if people read only the headline,they may think that the result are simply positive. But he warns that the coffee story is much more complicated. 普尔的意思是：如果人们只看表面,他们可能会认为结果是积极的.但他提醒我们,咖啡要复杂得多. He advises people to not drink more than four cups a day. And not everyone should drink so much coffee. 他建议人们每天最多和四杯咖啡,而且不是每个人都应该喝这么多. Researchers found that: Too much coffee during pregnancy can be dangerous. 研究人员发现: 怀孕期间喝太多咖啡会很危险. People,esecially woman,whose bones break easily should limit how much coffee they drink. 人们,尤其是女性,骨头容易骨折,应该限制她们饮用咖啡的量. People with abnormal heart beat patterns are advised to drink decaffeinated coffee. 心脏跳动不规律的人建议饮用无咖啡因的咖啡. In addition,the scientists point out that the research was only about coffee. Yet many coffee drinkers don’t just drink coffee. They put sugar into it. They add milk or cream. They may have a baked treat on the side. 此外,科学家们指出这项研究是关于咖啡的.然而,许多和咖啡的人并不只是喝咖啡.他们往里面放糖.他们家牛奶或奶油.他们还可能还同时吃一些烘焙食品. Researcher Robin Poole warns that to get the full health benefits of coffee,keep it simple.Drinking it black is the healthiest. And skip the pastries. 研究人员罗宾·普尔提醒我们,要想充分享受咖啡的健康益处,要尽量简单.喝黑咖啡是最健康的.糕点就放弃吧. It’s not about the sugar and the syrups and the biscuits,cakes and pastries. And we should urge people who are already drinking moderate amounts of coffee——about the three or four cups per day mark——to enjoy it,but try and make it as healthy as possible because standard health message still apply to those other things. 这本身与糖,糖浆,饼干,蛋糕和糕点无关,我们会监督那些已经喝了适量咖啡的人——大约每天喝三到四杯咖啡——可以尽情享受这些食物,但是尽量保持健康饮食,因为标准的健康饮食也同样适用于其他食物. The researchers found that the greatest benefit to drinking coffee seemed to be in fighting livers diseases. Based on that finding. They are planning a clinical test using coffee as a treatment for cirrhosis,a serious liver disease. 研究人员发现和咖啡最大的好处似乎是对抗肝脏疾病.基于这一发现,他们计划用咖啡来对肝硬化进行临床试验,肝硬化是一种严重的肝病. But the final takeaway is the same as before: if you drink coffee,keep it simple and don’t eat the pastries or other baked treats that often come with a cup of coffee. 但最终的结论还是和以前一样: 如果你和咖啡,保持简单,不要同时吃糕点或其他烘焙食品. And if you’re not coffee drinker,you don’t need to start drinking coffee to be healthier. 如果你不喝咖啡,你也不必用喝咖啡来保持健康. And that’s the Health &amp; Lifestyle report. I’m Anna Matteo. 这就是健康与生活报道,我是安娜·马特奥.

The free app,called Lookout,is currently available to users in the United States who own a Google Pixel device. The company says it hopes to bring Lookout to more devices and additional countries soon. 这款名为Lookout的免费应用,目前在美国拥有Google Pixel设备的用户都可以使用.谷歌公司表示,希望尽快让更多设备和国家可以使用Lookout应用. The app was first announced at Google’s I/O developer conference in May 2018. Since then,the company says it has been testing and working to improve te quality of its results. 该应用程序于2018年5月在谷歌的I/O开发者大会上首次发布.自那以后,该公司表示一直进行测试,并努力提高其结果质量. The app uses technology similar to Google Lens. That produt uses machine learning to recognize text and objects through device’s camera. Users can then receive information about or take actions related to the text and recognized objects. 该应用程序所使用的技术与Google Lens类似,Google Lens通过设备上的相机利用机器学习技术来识别文本和物体,然后,用户可以通过接收有关文本和可识别物体的信息继而采取相应的行动. Lookout builds on this same technology,but aims to provide assistance to people who are blind or have low vision. Lookout基于同样的技术,但这款应用旨在为盲人或视力低下的人提供帮助. The app users a devices’s camera to recognize text and objects and then provide voice descriptions about what is sees. 该应用程序使用设备的摄像头来识别文本和物体,然后提供对所见内容的语音描述. Lookout is not designed to describe everything,but instead seeks to search out things that people would most likely care about. The app can learn to judge what things are most important to a person over time. Lookout应用程序并不会对所有事务进行描述,而是寻找人们最关心的事情.随着时间的推移,这个应用程序可以学会判断什么是对用户来说是最重要的事情. Google says the app operates best when the wears a device around the neck or inside a pocket,with the camera lens pointed outward. 谷歌表示,当用户将设备戴在脖子上或放入口袋里,摄像头朝外时,应用程序运行效果最好. Lookout was thress main settings for people to use. Lookout应用有三种主要模式可供人们使用. The Explore setting is designed to provide assistance for people carrying out daily activities or for identifying things in new place. A Shopping setting can capture products and help users identify their money. The Quick Read setting can help users go through their email,read signs or identify other printed materials. 探索模式旨在为人们进行日常活动或识别新地方的事物提供帮助,购物模式可以捕获产品并帮助用户识别产品价格.快速阅读模式可以帮助用户浏览邮件,读取指示牌或识别其他印刷材料. User can control parts of the app through a fingeprint sensor. For example,the sensor can be used to change operating settings or go through recent result captured by the camera. The app has three different detail levels that can be activated to provide more or less information about objects. 用户可以通过指纹传感器控制应用程序的部分功能.例如,传感器可以用来改变操作模式或查看相机最近拍到的结果.这款应用提供三种不同的信息详细程序,激活后可以提供物体或多或少的信息. There are other apps and devices designed to assist these people,too. 还有其他的应用和设备为这些人提供帮助. Microsoft’s free Seeing AI app works similary to Google Lookout. Microsoft calls its system——launched for iPhone users in 2017 -a “talking camera for the blind.”,Seeing AI can recognize text,objects and people and speaks results to users. 微软的免费Seeing AI应用程序的工作原理与谷歌的Lookout应用乐类似.微软称其于2017年为iPhone用户推出的系统为: “盲人的语音相机”.Seeing AI可以识别文本,物体和人,并向用户播报结果. Microsoft says the system can provide audio sounds that relate to current light levels around the user. A recently released version also reportedly lets uers put their fingers over a photo of something to get a sense of how the object feels. The app produces smail vibrations sounds to help this process. 微软表示,该系统可以提供与当前用户周围光线水平相关的音频.据报道,最近发布的一个版本还允许用户将手指放在物体的照片上,以感知照片中的物体.这款应用程序会产生微小的震动和声音,为这一过程提供帮助. Another free app,called Be My Eyes,connects blind or low-sight individuals with sighted volunteers through live video calls. 另一款名为: “Be My Eyes”的免费应用程序通过实时的视频通话,将盲人或视力较低的人与视力正常的志愿者联系起来.

March 16 is International Sleep Day. 3月16日是国际睡眠日. And we should all celebrate the act of sleeping. Studies have shown that a good night’s rest helps us stay healthy,both mentally and physically. And researchers say sleep is probably the best tool we have for memeory and learning. 我们大家都应该庆祝睡眠这一行为.研究表明,晚上睡得好有益身心健康,研究人员说睡眠对记忆与学习来说也许是最佳的工具. Michael Twery is director of National Center on Sleep Disorders Research at Americal’s National Institutes of Health.Twery is an expert on the sicence of sleep and sleep disorders. He told me that a good night’s sleep helps to lean better. 迈克尔·特维里是美国国立卫生研究院睡眠絮乱研究中心的负责人,他是睡眠与睡眠障碍科学方面的专家,他跟我说晚间好的睡眠有助于学习. Getting a good night’s sleep is important for the learning and memory process. It’s important because it stores the training exercises and the learning exercises into our more permanent memory while we’re sleeping 7-8 hours in bed. And then the next morning when you wake up,your mind is better prepared to act on that information. 睡个好觉对于学习和记忆来说很重要,睡眠能够更加长久地存储我们的训练与学习信息,因为当我们睡七八个小时的时候,第二天早上起来时,你的大脑可以更好地准备处理那些信息. But what about getting durig the middle of the day? Short periods of sleep my help our brains work better,or so says a recent study on mapping. 不过在中午休息会如何? 最近,一项关于睡眠的调查表明,短时间睡眠有助于大脑的运转. Past studies have shown that mapping can help babies and young children learn better And napping can help brain performance in older adults. 以前的研究表明,宝宝和儿童午休有助于学习.对于年纪稍长的成年人来说,午休能够让大脑更好地运转. Taking a nap may also help this group of people fight off age-related memory loss. 午休也许能够帮助这些年轻人应对因年龄增长带来的记忆衰退. Many Americans do nap. But one-third of all adult in the United States are also chronically tired,notes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). It found that 50 million to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders. 许多美国人都有午休的习惯.不过,美国疾病控制和预防中心指出,三分之一的美国成年人都有慢性疲劳,有5000万到7000万的美国人患有慢性睡眠絮乱症. So,someone who naps as a way of paying off a sleep debt may not experience the same improvements from mapping as a healthy,well-rested person would. 所以,同样是午休,缺乏睡眠的人与睡眠充足的健康人士相比,效果没有那么好. Also,many people may not want to admit that they take naps. They may think that napping shows they are weak or lack energy. They only children,the very old,sick or lazy people nap is not an uncommon opinion. 很多人也不想承认他们有午休的习惯.他们也许认为午休说明自己身体很弱,没有精力.人们普遍认为,只有小孩,老人,多病的人和懒人才会午休. In fact,we Americans somethimes do a very strange thing. Some brag about how few hours of sleep they need each night. 事实上,美国人有时候会做一件非常奇怪的事,有人会吹嘘自己一晚休息的时间是如果如何得少. Health experts suggest that adults get seven to eight hours of sleep each night. People who claim they only sleep four or five hours a night,they may think thery are somehow stronger than the average human - superhuman,if you will. 健康专家建议成年人一晚睡七到八个小时.那些说自己一晚只睡四五个小时的人,他们自认为比常人更加强壮——或者说是超人. However,that may be changing. Many offices now offer napping rooms and napping cafes are appearning in many U.S. cities,including Washington,D.C. 然而,情况不同的.美国城市许多办公室都在提供午休的房间和休息咖啡室,包括华盛顿地区. While resting in the middle of the work day may seem like a luxury to Americans,napping is very much part of normal,everyday life in other parts of the world. 工作日午睡对于美国人来说也许很奢侈,但是对于全世界上其它国家与地区来说,午睡是日常生活的一部分. Take China,for example: While it depends on the age and job,China,generally speaking,is a land of nappers. 就拿中国来说吧,午睡因年龄和职业而异,中国可以说是一个”午睡之国”. So,researchers receently looked at information provided by nearly 3000 Chinese adults,aged 65 year or older. They wanted to learn if napping after a min-day meal,a tradition in many areas,had any effect on the mental performance of the subjects. 所以,近期研究人员查阅了由3000名65岁及以上的中国人所提供的信息.他们想知道午餐(许多地区的传统)是否会对身体有影响. First,the researchers asked the people if they napped and for how long. Then based on their answers,researchers put them into four groups: non-nappers(0 minutes),short nappers(less than 30 minutes),moderate nappers(30-90 minutes),and extended nappers(more than 90 minutes). 首先,研究人员问这些参与调查的人是否会午睡?睡多久?然后,根据他们的回答,把他们分为四组:不午睡的人,睡很短时间的人(少于30分钟),睡眠时间适中的人(30-90分钟),睡时间很长的人(超过90分钟). Nearly 60 percent of those 3,000 people said they did take a nap after lunch and that their naps lasted anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. Most of the subjects who said they napped said said they napped from about an hour. 在这3000人当中,近60%说自己午饭之后会午休30到90分钟.大多数会午睡的人一般都睡一个小时左右. The study found that people who took an hour-long map did much better on mental tests than those who did not nap. The hour-long nappers also did better on the test than those who napped for shorter and longer periods. In this study,it seems that the most effective nap lasted for about an hour,but not much longer. 研究发现,午休一个小时的体能检验结果比不午休的人好.睡一个小时的人比午休时间短于一小时或长于一小时的人测验结果更好.在这次研究中,似乎最佳睡眠时长是一个小时左右,但别睡太长时间. These researchers reported their findings in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. 这些研究人员在《美国老年学会杂志》上发布了他们的研究成果. Keep in mind,however,that these are the findings for those over the age of 65. 不过,要记住,这些研究成果是针对年龄在65岁以上的人. Yet Doctor Michael Twery notes that an hour long nap may be to long for young.healthy adults.”Currently,we’re recommending that we try to sleep for about 30 minutes or less. And 30 minutes is enough to remove the pressure to sleep and will help us feel more awake. If we nap longer,we will get trapped into those deeper layers of sleep,which can ben hard to get out of.” 不过迈克尔·特维里博士指出,对于身体健康的年轻人来说,午休一个小时或许太长了,”目前,我们建议大家睡30分钟或者更短,30分钟足够缓解睡眠压力,也会让我们更清醒.如果我们睡更长,会陷入深度睡眠,这样就很难醒过来了.” The feeling Twery described is called sleep inertia——the period when you awake from a very deep sleep. For a time.you are unable to think clearly. 特维里把这种感觉称为睡眠惯性——从深度睡眠中醒过来的那段时间.短时间之内,你无法清楚地思考. So sleep inertia is when someone is being awakened from deep sleep,Some individuals may find it hard to change instantly from that deep sleep——where everything is a bit foggy and confused to the fully awake state. We may be little bit clumsy. We may not have all our thoughts in order when we wake from deep sleep. 所以睡眠惯性就是人们从深度睡眠中醒过来,有些人会发现很难从深度睡眠中马上改变过来.或许我们有一点笨拙,从深度睡眠中醒过时来我们的思维并不是很清楚. The National Sleep Foundation also warns that if you have trouble falling asleep at night,limit your daytime nap to under 45 minutes. Also nap before 3 p.m. in the afternoon. 美国国家睡眠基金会警告称,如果晚上很难入眠,白天睡觉的时间要控制在45分钟之内,并且在下午三点之前进行午休. And that’s the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.

Java包名命名规范 Java的包名由小写单词组成,包的路径符合所开发的系统模块的定义,以便通过包名可得知其属于哪个模块,从而方便到对应包里找相应的实现类. 常规包名为了保障每个Java Package命名的唯一性,在Java编程规范中要求开发人员在自己定义的包名前加上唯一的前缀.由于互联网上的域名称是不会重复的,所以多数开发人员采用自己公司在互联网上的域名称作为自己程序包的唯一前缀.例如 : com.sun.swt... 公司项目 com : 公司项目,copyright由项目发起的公司所有. 包名 : com.公司名.项目名.模块名.. 团队项目 team : 团队项目,指由团队发起,并由该团队开发的项目,copyright属于该团队所有. 包名 : team.团队名.项目名.模块名.. 自定义包名一般公司命名为com.公司名.项目名.模块名....那我们个人的项目又怎么命名呢? 个人的英语单词有individual、personal、private、one-man,进一步对以上四个单词词意进行分析并在保证了唯一性,继而使用每个单词的前4个字母作为前缀,与com也做了区分.示例如下所示: indi : 个体项目,指个人发起,但非自己独自完成的项目,可公开或私有项目,copyright主要属于发起者. 包名 : indi.发起者名.项目名.模块名.. pers : 个人项目,指个人发起,独自完成,可分享的项目,copyright主要属于个人. 包名 : pers.个人名.项目名.模块名.. priv : 私有项目,指个人发起,独自完成,非公开的私人使用的项目,copyright属于个人. 包名 : priv.个人名.项目名.模块名.. onem : 与indi相同，推荐使用indi.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"Java reflection","slug":"Java-reflection","date":"2019-04-15T08:39:07.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.676Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/15/Java-reflection/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/04/15/Java-reflection/","excerpt":"","text":"Java Reflection概念Reflection(反射)是被认为动态语言的关键,反射机制允许程序在执行期间借助于Reflection API取得任何类的内部信息,并能直接操作任意对象的内部属性及方法. 应用动态代理 反射机制提供的功能 在运行时判断任意一个对象所属的类. 在运行时构造人任意一个类的对象. 在运行时判断任意一个类所具有的成员变量和方法. 在运行时调用任意一个对象的成员变量和方法. 生成动态代理(体现动态语言的特性). 反射相关的主要API java.lang.Class : 代表一个类. java.lang.reflect.Method : 代表类的方法. java.lang.reflect.Field : 代表类的成员变量. java.lang.reflect.Constructor : 代表类的构造方法. … 反射的简单应用示例 首先创建一个存储用户信息的类12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364package pers.huangyuhui.reflection.bean;/** * @ClassName: UserInfo * @Description: 用户信息 * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: Apr 15, 2019 9:03:40 AM * */public class UserInfo &#123; public String name; private String sex; private int age; public UserInfo() &#123; super(); &#125; public UserInfo(String name, String sex, int age) &#123; super(); this.name = name; this.sex = sex; this.age = age; &#125; public String getName() &#123; return name; &#125; public void setName(String name) &#123; this.name = name; &#125; public String getSex() &#123; return sex; &#125; public void setSex(String sex) &#123; this.sex = sex; &#125; public int getAge() &#123; return age; &#125; public void setAge(int age) &#123; this.age = age; &#125; @Override public String toString() &#123; return &quot;UserInfo [name=&quot; + name + &quot;, sex=&quot; + sex + &quot;, age=&quot; + age + &quot;]&quot;; &#125; public void showClassInfo() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;ClassInfo: Store the user information .&quot;); &#125; public void introduce(String s) &#123; System.out.println(s + &quot; my name is: &quot; + name + &quot; age: &quot; + age + &quot; sex: &quot; + sex); &#125;&#125; 其次利用反射获取该类中的信息1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374757677787980package pers.huangyuhui.reflection.bean.test;import java.lang.reflect.Field;import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;import java.lang.reflect.Method;import org.junit.Ignore;import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;import pers.huangyuhui.reflection.bean.UserInfo;/** * @ClassName: UserInfoTest * @Description: 用`反射`获取`UserInfo`类中信息 * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: Apr 15, 2019 9:10:08 AM * */public class TestUseInfoByReflection &#123; // 不使用反射 : 创建`UserInfo`类对象,并调用其中的属性及方法 // @Test @Ignore public void commonTest() &#123; UserInfo userInfo = new UserInfo(); userInfo.setName(&quot;Java reflection&quot;); userInfo.setAge(1); userInfo.setSex(&quot;Male&quot;); userInfo.showClassInfo(); userInfo.introduce(&quot;Hello !&quot;); &#125; // 使用反射: 创建`UserInfo`类对象,并调用其中的属性及方法 @Test public void reflectionTest() throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, NoSuchFieldException, SecurityException, NoSuchMethodException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException &#123; // 下述两行代码体现了: `UserInfo userInfo = new UserInfo();`的工作 Class&lt;UserInfo&gt; class1 = UserInfo.class; // 创建运行时类`UserInfo`类的对象 UserInfo userInfo = class1.newInstance(); System.out.println(userInfo); /* * 通过`getField`调用别`public`修饰的`name`属性并为其赋值 */ java.lang.reflect.Field fieldName = class1.getField(&quot;name&quot;);// `name`被`public`修饰,否则抛出: NoSuchFieldException fieldName.set(userInfo, &quot;Java reflection&quot;); System.out.println(userInfo); /* * 通过`getField`调用被`private`修饰的`age,sex`属性并为其赋值 */ Field fieldAge = class1.getDeclaredField(&quot;age&quot;); Field fieldSex = class1.getDeclaredField(&quot;sex&quot;); // 将此对象的 accessible 标志设置为指示的布尔值.值为 true 则指示反射的对象在使用时应该取消 Java 语言访问检查. // 值为 false 则指示反射的对象应该实施 Java 语言访问检查.实际上setAccessible是启用和禁用访问安全检查的开关, // 并不是为true就能访问为false就不能访问 !

(从空栈开始)n个操作的任意序列的平摊时间开销为O(n).(b) ：基于链表实现的栈 栈规模的增加和减少都是很简洁. 各个操作都是常数时间开销. 每个操作都要使用额外的空间和时间开销来处理指针. 栈的应用 举例1 ：将用户输入的字符反转 首先定义一个基于简单数组的栈 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051/** * @ClassName: SimpleStack * @Description: 栈 * @author: HuangYuhui * @date: Apr 10, 2019 8:50:56 PM * */public class SimpleStack &#123;

to unstage) deleted: themes/theme-nameUntracked files: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed) themes/theme-name///最后再执行: `git add themes/theme-name/` 就会发现可以成功备份该主题了哟 ! 原因分析 : 这是因为用到了git的子模块(git submodule)功能,既你在你的git项目里clone的他人的项目.在你的主项目的git库里,子模块只是一个HEAD指针,指向子模块的commit ..详情见下述参考的博客文章哟 (っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ 参考博客文章如下( 甚是感谢 ) : https://blog.itswincer.com/posts/7efd2818/ https://hoxis.github.io/hexo-backup-theme-dir.html","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"github_","slug":"github","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/github/"}]},{"title":"Servlet lifecycle","slug":"Servlet-lifecycle","date":"2019-04-06T15:06:10.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.696Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/06/Servlet-lifecycle/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/04/06/Servlet-lifecycle/","excerpt":"","text":"学习笔记 ：Java Servlet 的生命周期及其解析 Tomcat v9.0 + JDK 11 + Google Chrome Servlet lifecycle Servlet 2.5 示例 JSP program 1234567891011121314151617181920&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot;

Product(抽象产品角色) : 它是工厂类创建的所有对象的父类,封装了各种产品对象的公有方法,它的引入将提高系统的灵活性,使得在工厂类中只需定义一个通用的工厂方法,因为所有创建的具体产品对象都是其子类对象. ConcreteProduct(具体产品角色) : 它是简单的工厂模式的创建目标,所有被创建的对象都充当这个角色的某个具体类的实例,每一个具体产品角色都继承了抽象产品的角色.需要实现在抽象产品中声明的抽象方法. 实例说明123某软件公司要基于Java语言开发一套图表库,该图表库可以为应用程序提供多种不同外观的图表,例如柱状图(HistogramChart),饼状图(PieChart)折线图(LineChart)等..该软件公司图表库设计人员希望为应用系统人员提供一套灵活易用的图标库,通过设置不同的参数即可得到不同类型的图表.而且可以较为方便的对图表库进行扩展,以便能够在将来增加一些新类型的图表. 下述用简单工厂模式来设计该图表库 (1)Chart : 抽象图表接口,充当抽象产品类. 1234public interface Chart &#123; public void display();&#125; (2)HistogramChart : 柱状图类,充当具体产品类. 1234567891011public class HistogramChart implements Chart &#123; public HistogramChart() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;Create the histogram chart .&quot;); &#125; public void display() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;Display the histogram chart .&quot;); &#125;&#125; (3)PieChart : 饼状体类,充当具体产品类. 1234567891011public class PieChart implements Chart &#123; public PieChart() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;Create the pie chart .&quot;); &#125; public void display() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;Display the pie chart .&quot;); &#125;&#125; (4)LineChart : 折线图类,充当具体产品类. 1234567891011public class LineChart implements Chart &#123; public LineChart() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;Create the line chart .&quot;); &#125; public void display() &#123; System.out.println(&quot;Display the line chart .&quot;); &#125;&#125; (5)ChartFactory : 图表工厂类,充当工厂类. 1234567891011121314151617181920public class ChartFactory &#123; public static Chart getChart(String chartType) &#123; Chart chart = null; if (chartType.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;histogram&quot;)) &#123; chart = new HistogramChart(); System.out.println(&quot;Initialize the histogram chart .&quot;); &#125; else if (chartType.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;pie&quot;)) &#123; chart = new PieChart(); System.out.println(&quot;Initialize the pie chart .&quot;); &#125; else if (chartType.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;line&quot;)) &#123; chart = new LineChart(); System.out.println(&quot;Initialize the line chart .&quot;); &#125; else &#123; System.err.println(&quot;error : Please chakout your object name. &quot;); &#125; return chart; &#125;&#125; (6)SimpleFactoryPatternTest : 客户端测试类 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829public class SimpleFactoryPatternTest &#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; Chart chart = ChartFactory.getChart(&quot;histogram&quot;); chart.display(); Chart chart2 = ChartFactory.getChart(&quot;pie&quot;); chart2.display(); Chart chart3 = ChartFactory.getChart(&quot;line&quot;); chart3.display(); /*##The result be shown as followed:## Create the histogram chart .

Display the line chart . */ &#125;&#125; 不难发现,上述示例中在创建具体Chart对象时必须通过修改客户端代码中静态工厂方法的参数来更换具体产品对象.客户端代码需要重新编译,这对于客户端而言违反了开闭原则.下面介绍一种常用的解决方案,可以实现在不修改客户端代码的前提下能让客户端能够更换具体产品对象. 首先可以将静态的工厂方法的参数存储在XML格式的配置文件中(config.xml).如下所示 : 1234&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;config&gt; &lt;chartType&gt;histograma&lt;/chartType&gt;&lt;/config&gt; 再通过一个工具类XML Util来读取配置文件中的字符串参数,XMLUtil类的代码如下 : 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435public class XMLUtil &#123; private final static String path = &quot;src\\\\objctConfig.xml&quot;; // 该方法用于从XML配置文件中提取图表类型,并返回类型名. public static String getChartType() &#123; // 创建文档对象. DocumentBuilderFactory documentBuilderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); try &#123; DocumentBuilder documentBuilder = documentBuilderFactory.newDocumentBuilder(); Document document; document = documentBuilder.parse(new File(path)); // 获取包含图标类型的文本节点. NodeList nodeList = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;chartType&quot;); Node node = nodeList.item(0).getFirstChild(); String chartType = node.getNodeValue().trim(); return chartType; &#125; catch (ParserConfigurationException e) &#123; // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); &#125; catch (SAXException e) &#123; // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); &#125; catch (IOException e) &#123; // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); &#125; return null; &#125;&#125; 在引入配置文件和工具类XMLUtil之后,客户端代码SimpleFactoryPatternTest.java修改如下 : 123456789101112131415161718192021public class SimpleFactoryPatternTest &#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; /* * 通过读取配置文件中的参数来初始化指定的对象. */ String chartType = XMLUtil.getChartType(); Chart chart = ChartFactory.getChart(chartType); chart.display(); /*##The result be shown as followed:## Create the histogram chart . Initialize the histogram chart . Display the histogram chart . */ &#125;&#125; 不难发现,在上述客户端代码中并不包含任何与具体图标对象相关的信息,如果需要更换具体图标对象,只需要修改配置文件config.xml,无须修改任何原代码,既而符合开闭原则 开闭原则 : 是面向对象的可复用设计的第一块基石,它是最重要的面向对象设计原则.开闭原则由Bertrand Meyer于1998年提出,其定义如下 : 12345开闭原则 : 软件实体应当对扩展开放,对修改关闭.Open-Closed Principle(OCP) : Software entities should be open for extension,but closed for modification.在开闭原则的定义中,软件实体可以指一个软件模块,一个由多个类组成的局部结构或一个独立的类,开闭原则就是指软件实体应尽量在不修改原有代码的情况下进行扩展. 简单工厂模式优/缺点与适用环境简单工厂模式的优点 工厂类包含必要的判断逻辑,可以决定在什么时候创建哪一个产品类的实例,客户端可以避免直接创建产品对象的职责.而仅仅’消费’产品,简单工厂模式实现了对象创建和使用的分离. 客户端无须知道所创建的具体产品的类名.只需要知道具体产品类所对应的参数即可,对于一些复杂的类名,通过简单工厂模式可以在一定程度上减少使用者的记忆量. 通过引入配置文件,可以在不修改任何客户端代码的情况下更换和增加新的具体产品类,在一定程序上提高了系统的灵活性. 简单工厂模式的缺点 由于工厂类集中了所有产品的创建逻辑,职责过重,一旦不能正常工作,整个系统都要受到影响. 使用简单工厂模式势必会增加系统中类的个数(引入了新的工厂类),增加了系统的复杂度和理解难度. 系统扩展困难,一旦添加新产品就不得不修改工厂逻辑,在新产品类型较多时有可能造成工厂逻辑过于复杂,不利于系统的扩展和维护. 简单工厂模式由于使用了静态工厂方法,造成工厂角色无法形成基于继承的等级结构. 简单工厂模式的适用环境 工厂类负责创建的对象比较少,由于创建的对象比较少,不会造成工厂方法中的业务逻辑过于复杂. 客户端只知道传入工厂类的参数,对于如何创建对象并不关心. 参考书籍《 Java设计模式 》 作者: 刘伟 (可以说本书的代码示例写的非常用心,很适合初学者参考)","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Design Pattern","slug":"Design-Pattern","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Design-Pattern/"}]},{"title":"Spring 依赖注入","slug":"Spring-依赖注入","date":"2019-04-02T21:12:43.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.708Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/04/02/Spring-依赖注入/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/04/02/Spring-%E4%BE%9D%E8%B5%96%E6%B3%A8%E5%85%A5/","excerpt":"","text":"Spring framework 依赖注入篇如果想区分依赖注入与控制反转(IOC)两者之间的不同,可以参考Martin Fowler给出的解释.查看文章: GO 简单来说,依赖注入的情况如下 : 12345678public class A &#123; public void importantMethod() &#123; B b = ... // get an instance of B b.usefulMethod(); ... &#125; ...&#125; *如果要使用B,类A必须先获得组件B的实例引用,若B是一个具体类,则可以通过new关键字直接创建组件B实例.但是,如果B是接口,且有多个实现,则问题就变得复杂了,我们固然可以任意选择接口B的一个实现类,但这也意味着A的可重用性大大降低了,因为无法采用B的其他实现. 依赖注入是这样处理此类情景的 : 接管对象的创建工作,并将该对象的引用注入需要该对象的组件.以上述例子为例,依赖注入框架会分别创建对象A和对象B,将对象B注入到对象A中.为了能让框架进行依赖注入,程序员需要编写特定的set方法或构建方法,例如: 为了能将B注入到A中,类A会被修改成如下形式 : 123456789101112public class A &#123; private B b; public void importantMethod() &#123; // no need to worry about creating B anymore. // B b = ... // get an instance of B. b.usefulMethod(); ... &#125; public void setB(B b) &#123; this.b = b; &#125;&#125; 修改后的类A新增了一个setter方法,该方法将会被框架调用,以注入一个B的实例.由于对象依赖由依赖注入,类A的importantMethod()方法不再需要在调用B的usefulMethod()方法前去创建一个B的实例. 当然,也可以采用构造器方式注入,如下所示 : (本例中,Spring会先创建B的实例,再创建实例A,然后把B注入到实例A中.) 12345678910111213public class A &#123; private B b; public A(B b)&#123; this.b = b; &#125; public void importantMethod() &#123; // no need to worry about creating B anymore. // B b = ... // get an instance of B. b.usefulMethod(); ... &#125;&#125; 注意 : Spring 管理的对象称为beans . 1234567通过提供一个控制反转器(或者依赖注入器IOC),`Spring`为我们提供一种可以&#x27;聪明&#x27;地管理Java对象的依赖关系的方法.其优雅之处在于 : 程序员无须了解`Spring`框架的存在,更不需要引入任何`Spring`类型.使用`Spring`,程序几乎将所有重要对象的创建工作移交给了`Spring`,并配置如何注入依赖.`Spring`支持`XML`和`注解`两种配置方式.此外还需要创建是一个`ApplicationContext`对象,其代表一个`Spring`控制反转容器,`org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext`接口有多个实现,包括`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`和`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`.这两个实现都需要至少一个包含`beans`信息的`XML`文件. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext : 在类加载路径中加载配置文件.

Swing组件的外观与具体平台无关. 在Java中的开发包1.7之前，switch不支持String类型数据,case值和key值匹配时,程序会报错 ! 在一个类中可以定义为多个名称相同,但参数不同的方法,这种机制叫做：重载. 匿名内部类也就是没有名字的内部类,正因为没有名字,所以匿名内部类只能使用一次!它通常用来简化代码编写,但使用匿名内部类还有一个前提条 件：必须继承一个父类或实现一个接口 ! 类变量必须带有的修饰符为：static 在Java中二维数组定义的语法为：数据类型[][]数组名=new 数据类型[行数][列数]; 在Java.io包的字节输入流中,过滤器输入流的基类是: FilterInputStream 所有字符输入流都从Reader类继承,所有字符输出流都从Writer类继承. Swing除继续沿用了AWT中的FlowLayout,BorderLayout,CardLayout,GridLayout,GridBagLayout布局管理器外,新增了一个BoxLayout布局管理 器.BoxLayout布局管理器按照自上而下(y轴)或者从左到右(x轴)的顺序布局依次加入构件. java.awt.event包中定义了适配器类；该包中定义的适配器类包括以下几个: ComponentAdapter 构件适配器 ContainerAdapter 容器适配器 FocusAdapter 焦点适配器 MouseAdapter 鼠标适配器 KeyAdapter 键盘适配器 MouseMotionAdapter 鼠标运动适配器 WindowAdapters 窗口适配器 而FrameAdapter 不属于事件适配器类 !* 如果发生下面几种情况时,处于运行状态的线程就进入阻塞状态 : 线程调用sleep(); / join(); / wait();方法. 如果线程中使用sychronized来请求对象的所未获得时. 如果线程中有输入/输出操作,则进入阻塞状态;待输入/输出操作结束后,线程进入可运行状态. 在Java中,使用synchronized关键字标识临界区.Java平台将每个由synchronized语句设置的对象设置一个锁,称为对象锁,它是一种独占的排 他锁,既同一时刻最多只能有一个线程获取该锁,为了能够正常地使用对象锁，对共享数据的所有访问都必须在临界区内.同时临界区的共享数据必须是私 有的,确保只能通过对象的方法才能访问到. 算法的空间复杂度是指算法在执行过程中所需的内存空间.算法执行期间所需的存储空间包括3个部分: 输入数据的存储空间 程序本身所占的存储空间 算法执行过程中所需要的额外空间 需求分析是对待开发软件提出的需求进行分析并给出详细设计,是解决软件做什么的阶段. 软件设计可以使用的工具有总体结构图,程序流程图,N-S图,PAD图..注意：数据流程图(DFD)是需求分析使用的工具 ! 逻辑设计阶段形成逻辑数据模型(从E-R图向关系模式转换).注意点：关系模式设计属于：逻辑设计 能够运行Java字节码的命令为: javac break在java起到跳出循环的作用.continue是跳过当次循环继续执行下一次循环. XML只是一个配置文件通过流将XML件读取出来，并不属于字节流 ! yield()该方法与sleep()类似,只是不能由用户指定暂停多长时间,并且yield()方法只能让同优级的线程有执行的机会 ! javap的作用: Javap是 Java class文件分解器,可以反编译,也可以查看java编译器生成的字节码. 在数据库设计中,在需求分析阶段建立数据字典. 注意: 在 / 运算中并不存四舍五入的操作!只取整数部分! 正则表达式是一种描述某种匹配检索规则的字符串. java.util.regex 包中有一个Pattern类,用于进行快速模拟匹配. java.util.regex 包还具有一个Matcher匹配器类. javax.swing.text是文本类包,javax.swing.table是表格类包,javax.swing.plaf包括一些对外观样式操作的类和接口. JFrame是页面容器,JToolBar为工具条(属于容器的一种). Java中的线程包含CPU,代码,数据三个部分 interrupt();中断线程:中断状态被清除. start();用于开启一个线程. notify();用于唤醒一个处于等待状态的线程. 当一个Applet所在的浏览器被最小化以后,不能被调用的Applet方法是init() init(); 当浏览器加载applet,进行初始化的时候调用该方法. start(); 该方法在init()方法之后调用,当用户从其它页面转到包含applet的页面时该方法也被调用. stop(); 在用户离开包含applet的页面时被调用. destroy(); 当applet不再被使用,或浏览器退出的时候,该方法被调用. 操作题总结(重点+API介绍) 数组的算法排序继承于 Comparable JApplet(init()方法中接收来自html页面上的参数). 通过setName(String str);为继承Thread的子类的线程初始化名字. equals();方法比较的是两个字符串的内容是否相等.而 == 符号比较的是: 两个字符串的地址是否相同. 当程序中涉及鼠标点击事件需要继承MouseAdapter类来对鼠标做出的动作进行相应的回应 ! paint(Graphics g),调用 g.drawOval();可以画同心圆. Applet中绘制指定文本字符串使用：drawString(); Java中String类提供了charAt();方法遍历每个字符. 常用布局管理器 FlowLayout,BorderLayout,GridLayout,CardLayout,GridBagLayout. 注意: JLabel对象可以显示文本,图像或同时显示两者,创建对象时,在构造函数中输入要显示的对象即可. getContentPane();方法获得JFrame的内容面板. getSource(); 找到给定名称的资源. frame.pack();-Method in class java.awt. Window. 使此窗口的大小适合其子组件的首选大小和布局. JPanel是Java图形用户界面(GUI)工具包swing中的面板容器类,包含于javax.swing包,是一种轻量级容器,可以加入到JFrame窗体中,所以我们 需要继承此类作为画板供JFrame类来操作 通过鼠标点击获取相应的请求命令方法为: e.getActionCommand(); beep() - Method in class java.awt. Toolkit. 根据本地系统设置和硬件功能发出音频蜂鸣声. for example: Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep(); drawRect(int, int, int, int) - Method in class java.awt.Graphics 绘制指定矩形的轮廓. DataOutputStream 数据输出流允许应用程序以机器无关方式将Java基本数据类型写到底层输出流, DataInputStream 类提供readChar();方法来读取文件中的字符. Java IO 123 System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;); 获取当前的工作路径.getName(); 方法获取文件名，getPath();获取文件路径.isDirectory(); 判断是否是文件. extends Thread 与 implements Runnable 使用 123456789101112 当通过`implements Runnable`创建线程:将实现了Runnable接口的对象作为`target`参数传递给Thread类即可,格式如下:new Thread(`实现了Runnable接口的对象名`);举例: public class Java_2 implements Runnable &#123; public static void main(String[]args) &#123; Java_2 r = new Java_2(); Thread t = new Thread( r ); t.start(); &#125;··· 通过`extends Thread`创建线程:Thread本身实现了`Runnable`接口,重写其`run()`方法即可;线程创建后,需要调用`start();`方法运行. 12345setPreferredSize(new Dimension(280, 60));public void setPreferredSize(Dimension preferredSize)&#123;...&#125;将此组件的首选大小设置为常量值. 随后`getPreferredSize()`总是返回此值.将首选大小设置为`null`可恢复默认行为. `Dimension` : 类封装单个对象中组件的宽度和高度(以整数精度). DecimalFormat类提供的format();方法可以将数据格式化.123public class DecimalFormat extends NumberFormatDecimalFormat()&#123;...&#125;`DecimalFormat`是格式为十进制数的NumberFormat的具体子类. 它具有各种功能,旨在使任何地区的数字解析和格式化,包括支持西方,阿拉伯语和印度数字。它还支持不同类型的数字,包括整数(123..),定点数(123.4),科学记数法(1.23E4),百分比(12％),和货币金额(123美元),所有这些都可以进行本地化. 窗体事件 1234setDefaultCloseOperation(); 设置用户在此窗口上发起&quot;close&quot;时默认执行操作.JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE; `close`式关闭程序退出窗口.for example: frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); 常用事件类 12345public void addActionListener(ActionListener e)&#123;..&#125;添加指定的动作侦听器以从此按钮接收动作事件.当用户按下或释放鼠标在此按钮上时,会发生动作事件.如果`e`为空,则不会抛出任何异常.也不会执行任何操作.for example: saveButton.addActionListener(this); 哎哟终于写好了 ! 伸个懒腰 ٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶ ~ 最近没零花钱买麦斯威尔了,然后每天的状态就像下面的俺的小黄人一样 ╰( ´・ω・)つ──☆✿✿✿ 后期有时间还写推出NCRE-MySQL,NCRE-C,NCRE-三级数据库等全国计算机等考题目解析 ! 最近忙于备考,所以先写作先放一放 ~","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/Java/"},{"name":"NCRE","slug":"NCRE","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/tags/NCRE/"}]},{"title":"JDBC 常见错误分析","slug":"JDBC-常见错误分析","date":"2019-03-14T19:32:12.000Z","updated":"2022-01-05T03:09:17.672Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/14/JDBC-常见错误分析/","link":"","permalink":"https://goog.tech/blog/2019/03/14/JDBC-%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%94%99%E8%AF%AF%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/","excerpt":"","text":"JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity ) 常见错误分析今遇到一个网友问到JDBC中一个常见的错误,让我想起了大一时自己学习JDBC时整理的文档,继而公布出来分享给大家. 根据不同问题给出相应的解析问题一 : 加载驱动 Class.forName(&quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot;);错误 程序报错信息123456Loading class `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&#x27;.

- C语言描述著名计算机科学家沃思(Niklaus Wirth)曾提出一个程序公式：程序 = 数据结构 + 算法. 由此体现程序最美的灵魂所在 ~ 12345来! 小哥哥带大家体现一下`灵魂`的美 -(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾-约瑟夫问题(`Josephus problem `)是循环链表的一个典型应用,其描述如下: M个人围成一个圈,从其中任意一个人开始,按顺时针使所有人从一开始报数,报到N的人出列,然后使N之后的人接着从1开始报数,再次使报到N的人出列···如此下去,求出列的顺序及最后留下来的人的编号.很有趣的题目对吧! 小哥哥在这里简单实现一下哟 ~ Declare.h
