No big deal. <strong>Just three stories.</strong></p><h2 id="The-first-story"><a href="#The-first-story" class="headerlink" title="The first story"></a>The first story</h2><p><code>The first story is about connecting the dots.</code> </p><p>I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months.</p><p>But then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. </p><p>So why did I drop out ?</p><p>It started before I was born. </p><p>My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, </p><p>And she decided to put me up for adoption. </p><p>She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.</p><p>Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. </p><p>So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: </p><p>“We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him ?” </p><p>They said: “Of course.” </p><p>My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. </p><p>She refused to sign the final adoption papers. </p><p>She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.</p><p>This was the start in my life.</p><p>And 17 years later I did go to college. </p><p>But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, </p><p>And all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. </p><p>After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it.</p><p>I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. </p><p>And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. </p><p>So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. </p><p>It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. </p><p>The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting。</p><p>It wasn’t all romantic. </p><p>I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, </p><p>I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. </p><p>I loved it. </p><p>And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.</p><p>Let me give you one example:</p><p>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. </p><p>Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. </p><p>Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, </p><p>I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. </p><p>I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.</p><p>It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p><p>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.</p><p>But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. </p><p>And we designed it all into the Mac.</p><p>It was the first computer with beautiful typography. </p><p>If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. </p><p><strong>And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them.</strong></p><p>If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. </p><p>Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. </p><p>But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. </p><p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. </p><p>So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. </p><p>You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.</p><p>Because believing that dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that make all the difference.</p><h2 id="The-second-story"><a href="#The-second-story" class="headerlink" title="The second story"></a>The second story</h2><p><code>My second story is about love and loss.</code> </p><p>I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. </p><p>Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was twenty. </p><p>We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. </p><p>We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned thirty, and then I got fired. </p><p>How can you get fired from a company you started ? </p><p>Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me.</p><p>And for the first year or so things went well.</p><p>But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. </p><p>When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. </p><p>So at thirty I was out. and very publicly out.</p><p>What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</p><p>I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. </p><p>I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.</p><p>I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.</p><p>I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley.</p><p><strong>But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still loved what I did.</strong></p><p>The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.</p><p>I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p><p>I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. </p><p>The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again.</p><p>Less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</p><p>During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. </p><p>Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. </p><p>In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I retuned to Apple.</p><p>And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. </p><p>And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</p><p>I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. </p><p>It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. </p><p><strong>Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith.</strong></p><p><strong>I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.</strong> </p><p>You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.</p><p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.</p><p><strong>If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.</strong></p><p>As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. </p><p><strong>So keep looking. Don’t settle.</strong></p><h2 id="The-third-story"><a href="#The-third-story" class="headerlink" title="The third story"></a>The third story</h2><p><code>My third story is about death.</code> </p><p>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: </p><p>“If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” </p><p>It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: </p><p><strong>“If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today ?”</strong></p><p>And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p><p>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. </p><p>Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. </p><p>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. </p><p>You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p><p>About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. </p><p>I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. </p><p>I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. </p><p>The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. </p><p>My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. </p><p>It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. </p><p>It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.</p><p>It means to say your goodbyes.</p><p>I lived with that diagnosis all day. </p><p>Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. </p><p>I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. </p><p>I had the surgery and I’m fine now.</p><p>This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. </p><p>Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:</p><p>No one wants to die, even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. </p><p>And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. </p><p>And that is as it should be, <strong>because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.</strong> </p><p>It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you.</p><p>But someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. </p><p>Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</p><p><strong>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.</strong> </p><p><strong>Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.</strong></p><p><strong>Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.</strong> </p><p><strong>And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.</strong> </p><p>They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p><p>When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. </p><p>It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. </p><p>This was in the late 1960’s, before personal computers and desktop publishing.</p><p>So it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. </p><p>It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along.</p><p>It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p><p>Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course.</p><p>They put out a final issue. </p><p>It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. </p><p>On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, </p><p>The kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. </p><p>Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” </p><p><strong>It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</strong></p><p>And I have always wished that for myself.</p><p>And now, as you graduate to begin a new, I wish that for you. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</p><p><strong>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</strong></p><p>Thanks you all, very much.</p>]]></content>

Unfortunately, it’s regret that I didn’t have enough time to revise all the knowledge in the month-end, there has some reason as shown below for it :</p><ol><li><p>Realize some algorithms about the graph with code, such as <code>BFS</code>, <code>DFS</code>, <code>Prim</code>, <code>Kruskal</code>, <code>Dijkstra</code>, <code>Floyd</code>, and <code>TopologicalSorting</code> Algorithm</p></li><li><p>Realize some algorithms about the sort with code, such as <code>StraightInsertionSort</code>, <code>BinaryInsertionSort</code>, <code>ShellSort</code>, <code>BubbleSort</code>, <code>QuickSort</code>, <code>SimpleSectionSort</code>, <code>HeapSort</code>, <code>MergeSort</code>, and <code>RadixSort</code> Algorithm</p></li><li><p>Realize some algorithms about the tree with code, such as <code>PreorderTraversal</code>, <code>InorderTraversal</code>, <code>PostorderTraversal</code>, and <code>LevelOrderTraversal</code> Algorithm</p></li><li><p>Draw the knowledge mindmap</p></li></ol><p>But the final learn quality isn’t satisfactory to me because I wouldn’t like to finish the practice question after learning the new knowledge and <strong>blindly pursue the learning speed.</strong></p><h2 id="The-Subject-Of-Operating-System-408"><a href="#The-Subject-Of-Operating-System-408" class="headerlink" title="The Subject Of Operating System - 408"></a>The Subject Of Operating System - 408</h2><p>Just learns one chapter.</p><h2 id="Two-Thousand-English-Words"><a href="#Two-Thousand-English-Words" class="headerlink" title="Two Thousand English Words"></a>Two Thousand English Words</h2><p>This task only finished half, So what’s the reason for it. Yes, you guess right, that’s <strong>procrastination.</strong></p><h1 id="💪-Work-out"><a href="#💪-Work-out" class="headerlink" title="💪 Work out"></a>💪 Work out</h1><p>The total time of working out is <strong>603</strong> minutes, consumed <strong>4968</strong> calories. The primary data of working out is as shown below :</p><ol><li>the sum of running distance is <strong>19.41</strong> kilometers</li><li>there had twenty-five days which the exercise time was less than <strong>30</strong> min</li></ol><p>So terrible what I did this month, and this data is the lowest than the previous six months. The main reason is that I need time to adapt to the new environment, moreover <strong>hadn’t taken enough time to sleep.</strong></p><h1 id="😴-Rest"><a href="#😴-Rest" class="headerlink" title="😴 Rest"></a>😴 Rest</h1><p>The rest plan is to wake up at <strong>5:30</strong> am and go to sleep at <strong>22:30</strong> in the nighttime, but concrete daily data didn’t record due to the <strong>procrastination.</strong> In this month, I often watch some short videos on my mobile phone all night so that the learning status is bad all daytime. That seems like a loop cycle and became a habit finally. That’s why the learning efficiency is so low in daily life.</p><h1 id="💲-Consumption"><a href="#💲-Consumption" class="headerlink" title="💲 Consumption"></a>💲 Consumption</h1><p>The excess consumption is <strong>219￥</strong> and other data is private.</p><h1 id="💬-Comment"><a href="#💬-Comment" class="headerlink" title="💬 Comment"></a>💬 Comment</h1><ol><li>Not pursue the learning speed but more effectiveness</li><li>Make the best of the daytime and keep early hours</li><li>Get out procrastination</li></ol><blockquote><p>😔 <strong>By the way, there had a few days I feel anxious all day because my resume fell on deaf ears.</strong></p></blockquote>]]></content>

对<code>文件(夹)</code>的组织用的什么数据结构？<br>A、 线性表结构<br>B、 树结构<br>C、 图结构<br>D、 集合 </p><blockquote><p>答案: B</p></blockquote><p>2、在存储数据时, 通常不仅要存储各数据元素的<code>值</code>, 而且还要存储_____。<br>A、 数据的存储方法<br>B、 数据元素的类型<br>C、 数据的处理方法<br>D、 数据元素之间的关系</p><blockquote><p>答案: D </p></blockquote><p>3、通常要求同一<code>逻辑结构</code>中的所有数据元素具有相同的特性, 这意味着_____。<br>A、 数据元素具有同一特点<br>B、 数据元素所包含的数据项的个数要相等<br>C、 每个数据元素都一样<br>D、 不仅数据元素所包含的数据项的<code>个数</code>要相同, 而且对应的数据项的<code>类型</code>要一致 </p><blockquote><p>答案: D</p></blockquote><p>4、以下说法正确的是_____。<br>A、 数据元素是数据的最小单位<br>B、 数据结构是带结构的各数据项的集合<br>C、 数据项是数据的基本单位<br>D、 一些表面上很不相同的数据可以有相同的逻辑结构 </p><blockquote><p>答案: D</p><p>A : 数据元素是数据的基本单位</p><p>B : 数据结构是相互之间存在一种或多种特定关系的数据元素的集合</p><p>C : 数据项是数据元素不可分割的最小单位, 一个数据元素可由若干个数据项( <code>Data Item</code> )组成</p></blockquote><p>6、_____表示<code>结点</code>之间的<code>层次</code>关系<br>A、 线性表结构<br>B、 树结构<br>C、 图结构<br>D、 散结构 </p><blockquote><p>答案: B, 同第 1 题哈~</p></blockquote><p>7、下面关于数据的<code>逻辑结构</code>与<code>存储结构</code>说法正确的是_____<br>A、 逻辑结构要体现出存储结构<br>B、 存储结构要体现出逻辑结构<br>C、 二者含义是一样的<br>D、 二者毫无关系 </p><blockquote><p>答案: B</p><p>解析 :

毫无疑问线上大会的演讲及互动性并没有现场有激情, 毕竟今年初爆发的疫情( <code>COVID-19</code> )到现在也没有太大的好转, 还是只能靠隔离来尽量控制疫情的传播, 愿在 <code>2021 除夕夜</code> 来临之前各地区都可以解封, 进而可以与亲人们相聚一堂, 举杯欢笑~  在看完 Google 开发者大会后我深深地被 <code>TensorFlow</code> 吸引住了! 它最初是由谷歌大脑团队开发, 于 2015 开源的一个深度学习框架( <code>Deep Learning Framework</code> ). 众所周知, 深度学习是机器学习( <code>Machine Learning</code> ) 的一个分支啦. 对了, Google 在 MOOC 上还启动了名为 <code>Grow With Google</code> 的课程计划, 其中就包括了 <code>TensorFlow 入门及实战</code> 等教程. 如果你的英文不太好可以去参加并学习下这个根据 TensorFlow 官方教程汉化来的课程哈! 最近临近期末考试压力很大, 所以不可能再花课下时间去学习 TensorFlow 了, 尽管我已经使用 <code>gitbook</code> 插件搭建好了 TensorFlow 学习笔记的站点hhh, 其域名为 : <em><a href="https://tensorflow.studynote.life/">https://tensorflow.studynote.life</a></em> . 寒假再学习它吧 !</li></ul><img src="/blog/2020/11/26/%E5%98%BF%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%8E%E4%BB%AC-%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%85%E4%B8%8D%E8%A7%81%E6%83%B3%E6%88%91%E4%BA%86%E5%98%9B/github-repo_awesome-tensorflow-tutorial.PNG" class="" title="awesome-tensorflow-tutorial github repo screenshot"><blockquote><p>TensorFlow 入门实操课程( MOOC ) : <a href="https://www.icourse163.org/course/youdao-1460578162">https://www.icourse163.org/course/youdao-1460578162</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>《机器学习基础》系列课程( Bilibili ) : <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ja4y1W7as">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ja4y1W7as</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>github address : <a href="https://github.com/GoogTech/awesome-tensorflow-tutorial">https://github.com/GoogTech/awesome-tensorflow-tutorial</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="入手树莓派4B-新更内容-2021-1-20"><a href="#入手树莓派4B-新更内容-2021-1-20" class="headerlink" title="入手树莓派4B( 新更内容 2021-1-20 )"></a>入手树莓派4B( 新更内容 2021-1-20 )</h2><ul><li><code>2020 年 12 月 21 号</code>我入手了我的第一个树莓派, 其型号为 <code>Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB</code>, 从此便开始了比软件更有趣的硬件开发之旅. 期间我写了很多有趣的小玩意儿, 例如我利用<code>百度语音识别 API</code>及<code>Python 爬虫技术</code>写了一个自动语音播报天气预报的程序, 并利用<code>Server酱</code>将其数据按时推送微信. 后来觉得这个程序比较被动, 即灵活性比较差劲, 所以就开发了名为 <code>voiceAsssitant</code>, 即语音助手项目, 它使用 <code>Snowboy</code> 作为唤醒词, 并将前面所说的天气语音播报程序作为<code>功能插件</code>集成到了该项目中, 当然我还集成了很多其它的功能插件, 例如<code>播报树莓派系统信息</code>、<code>播报百度的热点事件或微博热门话题</code>、<code>播报猫眼或豆瓣电影排行榜</code>、<code>播报指定日期的精确倒计时</code>等简易功能插件. 如果你对树莓派感兴趣, 那么欢迎你加入我在 Github 上所创建的<code>树莓派组织</code> : <em><a href="https://github.com/raspberry-pi-org">https://github.com/raspberry-pi-org</a></em>. 该组织还开源了面向树莓派爱好者的<code>树莓派教程 • GitBook</code> : <em><a href="https://book.raspi.website/">https://book.raspi.website</a></em>, 以上所说的该组织开源的项目都被展示在这里哟 : <em><a href="https://raspi.website/">https://raspi.website</a></em>.  尽管我现在仅仅是一个小白, 但非常欢迎及期待你的加入、贡献以及建议~</li></ul><img src="/blog/2020/11/26/%E5%98%BF%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%8E%E4%BB%AC-%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%85%E4%B8%8D%E8%A7%81%E6%83%B3%E6%88%91%E4%BA%86%E5%98%9B/github-org_raspberry-pi-org.png" class="" title="raspberry pi organization web page screenshot"><img src="/blog/2020/11/26/%E5%98%BF%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%8E%E4%BB%AC-%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%85%E4%B8%8D%E8%A7%81%E6%83%B3%E6%88%91%E4%BA%86%E5%98%9B/www.raspi.website.png" class="" title="www.raspi.website web page screenshot"><img src="/blog/2020/11/26/%E5%98%BF%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%8E%E4%BB%AC-%E5%A5%BD%E4%B9%85%E4%B8%8D%E8%A7%81%E6%83%B3%E6%88%91%E4%BA%86%E5%98%9B/www.book.raspi.website.png" class="" title="www.book.raspi.website web page screenshot"><h1 id="🥚-彩蛋"><a href="#🥚-彩蛋" class="headerlink" title="🥚 彩蛋"></a>🥚 彩蛋</h1><p>下面是两篇待发布的且无关 <code>Coding</code> 的博文. . . 看这标题算不算一个大彩蛋🥚呢嘿嘿~ 最近临近期末考试, 所以说每天都有很多日计划需要去完成, 我会尽快发布以下两篇文章的!
